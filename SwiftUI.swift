/// provides a mechanical feel to the animation because its speed is consistent
/// from start to finish. In contrast, an animation that uses easing, like
/// ``easeOut``, offers a more natural feel by varying the acceleration
/// of the animation.
///
/// To apply an animation to a view, add the ``View/animation(_:value:)``
/// modifier, and specify both an animation type and the value to animate. For
/// instance, the ``Circle`` view in the following code performs an
/// ``easeIn`` animation each time the state variable `scale` changes:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         @State private var scale = 0.5
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Circle()

///                 HStack {
///                     Button("+") { scale += 0.1 }
///                     Button("-") { scale -= 0.1 }

///             }
///             .padding()
///         }
///     }
///
/// When the value of `scale` changes, the modifier
/// ``View/scaleEffect(_:anchor:)-pmi7`` resizes ``Circle`` according to the
/// new value. SwiftUI can animate the transition between sizes because
/// ``Circle`` conforms to the ``Shape`` protocol. Shapes in SwiftUI conform to
/// the ``Animatable`` protocol, which describes how to animate a property of a
/// view.
///
/// In addition to adding an animation to a view, you can also configure the
/// animation by applying animation modifiers to the animation type. For
/// example, you can:
///
/// - Delay the start of the animation by using the ``delay(_:)`` modifier.
/// - Repeat the animation by using the ``repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)`` or
/// ``repeatForever(autoreverses:)`` modifiers.
/// - Change the speed of the animation by using the ``speed(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// For example, the ``Circle`` view in the following code repeats
/// the ``easeIn`` animation three times by using the
/// ``repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)`` modifier:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         @State private var scale = 0.5
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Circle()
///                     .scaleEffect(scale)
///                     .animation(.easeIn.repeatCount(3), value: scale)
///                 HStack {
///                     Button("+") { scale += 0.1 }
///                     Button("-") { scale -= 0.1 }
///                 }
///             }
///             .padding()
///         }
///     }
///
/// A view can also perform an animation when a binding value changes. To

    /// user interface.

    /// For example, you can create a basic vertical stack that places views

    ///         }
    ///
    ///         // This layout also needs a sizeThatFits() implementation.
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The example creates a placement point that starts at the origin of the
    /// specified `bounds` input and uses that to place the first subview. It
    /// then moves the point in the y dimension by the subview's height,
    /// which it reads using the ``LayoutSubview/dimensions(in:)`` method.
    /// This prepares the point for the next iteration of the loop. All
    /// subview operations use an ``ProposedViewSize/unspecified`` size
    /// proposal to indicate that subviews should use and report their ideal
    /// size.
    ///
    /// A more complex layout container might add space between subviews
    /// according to their ``LayoutSubview/spacing`` preferences, or a
    /// fixed space based on input configuration. For example, you can extend
    /// the basic vertical stack's placement method to calculate the
    /// preferred distances between adjacent subviews and store the results in
    /// an array:
    ///
    ///     let spacing: [CGFloat] = subviews.indices.dropLast().map { index in
    ///         subviews[index].spacing.distance(
    ///             to: subviews[index + 1].spacing,
    ///             along: .vertical)
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The spacing's ``ViewSpacing/distance(to:along:)`` method considers the
    /// preferences of adjacent views on the edge where they meet. It returns
    /// the smallest distance that satisfies both views' preferences for the
    /// given edge. For example, if one view prefers at least `2` points on its
    /// bottom edge, and the next view prefers at least `8` points on its top
    /// edge, the distance method returns `8`, because that's the smallest
    /// value that satisfies both preferences.
    ///
    /// Update the placement calculations to use the spacing values:
    ///
    ///     var point = bounds.origin
    ///     for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {
    ///         if index > 0 { point.y += spacing[index - 1] } // Add spacing.
    ///         subview.place(at: point, anchor: .topLeading, proposal: .unspecified)
    ///         point.y += subview.dimensions(in: .unspecified).height
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Be sure that you use computations during placement that are consistent
    /// with those in your implementation of other protocol methods for a given
    /// set of inputs. For example, if you add spacing during placement,
    /// make sure your implementation of

/// A control that initiates an action.
///
/// You create a button by providing an action and a label. The action is either
/// a method or closure property that does something when a user clicks or taps
/// the button. The label is a view that describes the button's action --- for
/// example, by showing text, an icon, or both:
///
///     Button(action: signIn) {
///         Text("Sign In")
///     }
///
/// For the common case of text-only labels, you can use the convenience
/// initializer that takes a title string or ``LocalizedStringKey`` as its first
/// parameter, instead of a trailing closure:
///
///     Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
///
/// How the user activates the button varies by platform:
/// - In iOS and watchOS, the user taps the button.
/// - In macOS, the user clicks the button.
/// - In tvOS, the user presses "select" on an
///   external remote, like the Siri Remote, while focusing on the button.
///
/// The appearance of the button depends on factors like where you
/// place it, whether you assign it a role, and how you style it.
///
/// ### Adding buttons to containers
///
/// Use buttons for any user interface element that initiates an action.
/// Buttons automatically adapt their visual style to match the expected style
/// within these different containers and contexts. For example, to create a
/// ``List`` cell that initiates an action when selected by the user, add a
/// button to the list's content:
///
///     List {
///         // Cells that show all the current folders.
///         ForEach(folders) { folder in
///             Text(folder.title)
///         }
///
///         // A cell that, when selected, adds a new folder.
///         Button(action: addItem) {
///             Label("Add Folder", systemImage: "folder.badge.plus")
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot of a list of four items. The first three items use a
/// grayscale foreground color and have the text Documents, Downloads,
/// and Recents. The last item has a blue foreground color and shows
/// a folder icon with the text Add Folder.](Button-1)
///
/// Similarly, to create a context menu item that initiates an action, add a
/// button to the ``View/contextMenu(_:)`` modifier's content closure:
///
///     .contextMenu {
///         Button("Cut", action: cut)
///         Button("Copy", action: copy)
///         Button("Paste", action: paste)
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot of a context menu that contains the three items Cut, Copy,
/// and Paste.](Button-2)
///
/// This pattern extends to most other container views in SwiftUI that have
/// customizable, interactive content, like ``Form`` instances.
///
/// ### Assigning a role
///
/// You can optionally initialize a button with a ``ButtonRole`` that
/// characterizes the button's purpose. For example, you can create a
/// ``ButtonRole/destructive`` button for a deletion action:
///
///      Button("Delete", role: .destructive, action: delete)
///
/// The system uses the button's role to style the button appropriately
/// in every context. For example, a destructive button in a contextual menu
/// appears with a red foreground color:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a context menu that contains the four items Cut, Copy,
/// Paste, and Delete. The last item uses a foreground color of red.](Button-3)
///
/// If you don't specify a role for a button, the system applies an
/// appropriate default appearance.
///
/// ### Styling buttons
///
/// You can customize a button's appearance using one of the standard button
/// styles, like ``PrimitiveButtonStyle/bordered``, and apply the style with the
/// ``View/buttonStyle(_:)-66fbx`` modifier:
///
///     HStack {
///         Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
///         Button("Register", action: register)
///     }
///     .buttonStyle(.bordered)
///
/// If you apply the style to a container view, as in the example above,
/// all the buttons in the container use the style:
///
/// ![A screenshot of two buttons, side by side, each with a capsule shaped
/// background. The label for the first button is Sign In; the right button is
/// Register.](Button-4)
///
/// You can also create custom styles. To add a custom appearance with
/// standard interaction behavior, create a style that conforms to the
/// ``ButtonStyle`` protocol. To customize both appearance and interaction
/// behavior, create a style that conforms to the ``PrimitiveButtonStyle``
/// protocol. Custom styles can also read the button's role and use it to
/// adjust the button's appearance.

/// ### Viewing documents
///
/// If your app only needs to display but not modify a specific

///
///     @main

///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Supporting multiple document types
///
/// Your app can support multiple document types by adding additional
/// document group scenes:
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             DocumentGroup(newDocument: TextFile()) { group in

///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Accessing the document's URL
///
/// If your app needs to know the document's URL, you can read it from the `editor`
/// closure's `configuration` parameter, along with the binding to the document.
/// When you create a new document, the configuration's `fileURL` property is `nil`.
/// Every time it changes, it is passed over to the `DocumentGroup` builder
/// in the updated `configuration`.
/// This ensures that the view you define in the closure always knows
/// the URL of the document it hosts.
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             DocumentGroup(newDocument: TextFile()) { configuration in
///                 ContentView(
///                     document: configuration.$document,
///                     fileURL: configuration.fileURL
///                 )
///             }
///         }
///     }

/// in the user interface.
/// Don't access the document's contents or metadata using the URL because that
/// can conflict with the management of the file that SwiftUI performs.

///
///     MyView()
///         .lineLimit(2)
///
/// In some cases, using a dedicated view modifier provides additional

///                 .focused($focusedField, equals: .fullName)
///         }
///     }
///
/// On the other hand, binding the same value to two views is ambiguous. In
/// the following example, two separate fields bind focus to the `name` value:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         enum Field: Hashable {
///             case name
///             case fullName

/// rectangle into the main context:
///
///     // Create a copy of the context to draw a clipped ellipse.
///     var maskedContext = context
///     let halfSize = size.applying(CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 0.5, y: 0.5))
///     maskedContext.clip(to: Path(CGRect(origin: .zero, size: halfSize)))
///     maskedContext.fill(
///         Path(ellipseIn: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size)),
///         with: .color(.green))
///
///     // Go back to the original context to draw the rectangle.
///     let origin = CGPoint(x: size.width / 4, y: size.height / 4)
///     context.fill(
///         Path(CGRect(origin: origin, size: halfSize)),
///         with: .color(.blue))
///
/// The mask doesn't clip the rectangle because the mask isn't part of the
/// main context. However, both contexts draw into the same view because
/// you created one context as a copy of the other:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a view that shows the upper left quarter of a green

/// A container view that arranges other views in a two dimensional layout.
///
/// Create a two dimensional layout by initializing a `Grid` with a collection
/// of ``GridRow`` structures. The first view in each grid row appears in
/// the grid's first column, the second view in the second column, and so
/// on. The following example creates a grid with two rows and two columns:
///
///     Grid {
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Hello")
///             Image(systemName: "globe")
///         }
///         GridRow {
///             Image(systemName: "hand.wave")
///             Text("World")
///         }
///     }
///
/// A grid and its rows behave something like a collection of ``HStack``
/// instances wrapped in a ``VStack``. However, the grid handles row and column
/// creation as a single operation, which applies alignment and spacing to
/// cells, rather than first to rows and then to a column of unrelated rows.
/// The grid produced by the example above demonstrates this:
///
/// ![A screenshot of items arranged in a grid. The upper-left
/// position in the grid contains the word hello. The upper-right contains
/// an image of a globe. The lower-left contains an image of a waving hand.
/// The lower-right contains the word world. The cells of the grid
/// have minimal vertical or horizontal spacing.](Grid-1-iOS)
///
/// > Note: If you need a grid that conforms to the ``Layout``
/// protocol, like when you want to create a conditional layout using
/// ``AnyLayout``, use ``GridLayout`` instead.
///
/// ### Multicolumn cells
///
/// If you provide a view rather than a ``GridRow`` as an element in the
/// grid's content, the grid uses the view to create a row that spans all of
/// the grid's columns. For example, you can add a ``Divider`` between the
/// rows of the previous example:
///
///     Grid {
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Hello")
///             Image(systemName: "globe")
///         }
///         Divider()
///         GridRow {
///             Image(systemName: "hand.wave")
///             Text("World")
///         }
///     }
///
/// Because a divider takes as much horizontal space as its parent offers, the
/// entire grid widens to fill the width offered by its parent view.
///
/// ![A screenshot of items arranged in a grid. The upper-left
/// cell in the grid contains the word hello. The upper right contains
/// an image of a globe. The lower-left contains an image of a waving hand.
/// The lower-right contains the word world. A dividing line that spans
/// the width of the grid separates the upper and lower elements. The grid's
/// rows have minimal vertical spacing, but it's columns have a lot of
/// horizontal spacing, with column content centered horizontally.](Grid-2-iOS)
///
/// To prevent a flexible view from taking more space on a given axis than the
/// other cells in a row or column require, add the
/// ``View/gridCellUnsizedAxes(_:)`` view modifier to the view:
///
///     Divider()
///         .gridCellUnsizedAxes(.horizontal)
///
/// This restores the grid to the width that the text and images require:
///
/// ![A screenshot of items arranged in a grid. The upper-left
/// position in the grid contains the word hello. The upper-right contains
/// an image of a globe. The lower-left contains an image of a waving hand.
/// The lower-right contains the word world. A dividing line that spans
/// the width of the grid separates the upper and lower elements. The grid's
/// rows and columns have minimal vertical or horizontal spacing.](Grid-3-iOS)
///
/// To make a cell span a specific number of columns rather than the whole
/// grid, use the ``View/gridCellColumns(_:)`` modifier on a view that's
/// contained inside a ``GridRow``.
///
/// ### Column count
///
/// The grid's column count grows to handle the row with the largest number of
/// columns. If you create rows with different numbers of columns, the grid
/// adds empty cells to the trailing edge of rows that have fewer columns.
/// The example below creates three rows with different column counts:
///
///     Grid {
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Row 1")
///             ForEach(0..<2) { _ in Color.red }
///         }
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Row 2")
///             ForEach(0..<5) { _ in Color.green }
///         }
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Row 3")
///             ForEach(0..<4) { _ in Color.blue }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The resulting grid has as many columns as the widest row, adding empty
/// cells to rows that don't specify enough views:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a grid with three rows and six columns. The first
/// column contains cells with the labels Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3, reading
/// from top to bottom. The text is centered in the cell in each case. The
/// other columns contain cells that are either filled with a rectangle, or
/// that are empty. Scanning from left to right, the first row contains two
/// red rectangle cells after its label cell, and then three empty cells.
/// The second row contains five green rectangle cells after its label cell.
/// The third row contains four blue rectangle cells after its label cell,
/// and then one empty cell. There's 20 points of space between each of
/// the cells.](Grid-4-iOS)
///
/// The grid sets the width of all the cells in a column to match the needs of
/// column's widest cell. In the example above, the width of the first column
/// depends on the width of the widest ``Text`` view that the column contains.
/// The other columns, which contain flexible ``Color`` views, share the
/// remaining horizontal space offered by the grid's parent view equally.
///
/// Similarly, the tallest cell in a row sets the height of the entire row.
/// The cells in the first column of the grid above need only the height
/// required for each string, but the ``Color`` cells expand to equally share
/// the total height available to the grid. As a result, the color cells
/// determine the row heights.
///
/// ### Cell spacing and alignment
///
/// You can control the spacing between cells in both the horizontal and
/// vertical dimensions and set a default alignment for the content in all
/// the grid cells when you initialize the grid using the
/// ``init(alignment:horizontalSpacing:verticalSpacing:content:)`` initializer.
/// Consider a modified version of the previous example:
///
///     Grid(alignment: .bottom, horizontalSpacing: 1, verticalSpacing: 1) {
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// This configuration causes all of the cells to use ``Alignment/bottom``
/// alignment --- which only affects the text cells because the colors fill
/// their cells completely --- and it reduces the spacing between cells:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a grid with three rows and six columns. The first
/// column contains cells with the labels Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3, reading
/// from top to bottom. The text is horizontally centered and bottom aligned
/// in the cell in each case. The other columns contain cells that are either
/// filled with a rectangle, or that are empty. Scanning from left to right,
/// the first row contains two red rectangle cells after its label cell, and
/// then three empty cells. The second row contains five green rectangle cells
/// after its label cell. The third row contains four blue rectangle cells
/// after its label cell, and then one empty cell. There's 1 point of space
/// between each of the cells.](Grid-5-iOS)
///
/// You can override the alignment of specific cells or groups of cells. For
/// example, you can change the horizontal alignment of the cells in a column
/// by adding the ``View/gridColumnAlignment(_:)`` modifier, or the vertical
/// alignment of the cells in a row by configuring the row's
/// ``GridRow/init(alignment:content:)`` initializer. You can also align
/// a single cell with the ``View/gridCellAnchor(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// ### Performance considerations
///
/// A grid can size its rows and columns correctly because
/// it renders all of its child views immediately. If your app exhibits
/// poor performance when it first displays a large grid that appears
/// inside a ``ScrollView``, consider switching to a ``LazyVGrid`` or
/// ``LazyHGrid`` instead.
///
/// Lazy grids render their cells when SwiftUI needs to display
/// them, rather than all at once. This reduces the initial cost of displaying
/// a large scrollable grid that's never fully visible, but also reduces the
/// grid's ability to optimally lay out cells. Switch to a lazy grid only if
/// profiling your code shows a worthwhile performance improvement.

    /// Creates and initializes a cache for a layout instance.
    ///
    /// You can optionally use a cache to preserve calculated values across
    /// calls to a layout container's methods. Many layout types don't need
    /// a cache, because SwiftUI automatically reuses both the results of
    /// calls into the layout and the values that the layout reads from its
    /// subviews. Rely on the protocol's default implementation of this method
    /// if you don't need a cache.
    ///
    /// However you might find a cache useful when:
    ///
    /// - The layout container repeats complex, intermediate calculations
    /// across calls like ``sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)``,
    /// ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)``, and
    /// ``explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)-8ofeu``.
    /// You might be able to improve performance by calculating values
    /// once and storing them in a cache.
    /// - The layout container reads many ``LayoutValueKey`` values from
    /// subviews. It might be more efficient to do that once and store the
    /// results in the cache, rather than rereading the subviews' values before
    /// each layout call.
    /// - You want to maintain working storage, like temporary Swift arrays,
    /// across calls into the layout, to minimize the number of allocation
    /// events.

    /// ### Initialize a cache
    ///
    /// Implement the `makeCache(subviews:)` method to create a cache.
    /// You can add computed values to the cache right away, using information
    /// from the `subviews` input parameter, or you can do that later. The
    /// methods of the ``Layout`` protocol that can access the cache
    /// take the cache as an in-out parameter, which enables you to modify
    /// the cache anywhere that you can read it.
    ///
    /// You can use any storage type that makes sense for your layout
    /// algorithm, but be sure that you only store data that you derive
    /// from the layout and its subviews (lazily, if possible). For this to
    /// work correctly, SwiftUI needs to be able to call this method to
    /// recreate the cache without changing the layout result.
    ///
    /// When you return a cache from this method, you implicitly define a type
    /// for your cache. Be sure to either make the type of the `cache`
    /// parameters on your other ``Layout`` protocol methods match, or use
    /// a type alias to define the ``Cache`` associated type.
    ///
    /// ### Update the cache
    ///
    /// If the layout container or any of its subviews change, SwiftUI
    /// calls the ``updateCache(_:subviews:)-9hkj9`` method so you can
    /// modify or invalidate the contents of the
    /// cache. The default implementation of that method calls the
    /// `makeCache(subviews:)` method to recreate the cache, but you can
    /// provide your own implementation of the update method to take an
    /// incremental approach, if appropriate.

    /// input and always returns the same value for a given set of subviews.

/// Because you create a group of views with a ``SwiftUI/ViewBuilder``, you can

///             LoginView()
///         }
///     }
///     .navigationBarTitle("Start")

/// The modifier applies to all members of the group --- and not to the group
/// itself. For example, if you apply ``View/onAppear(perform:)`` to the above
/// group, it applies to all of the views produced by the `if isLoggedIn`
/// conditional, and it executes every time `isLoggedIn` changes.
///
/// Because a group of views itself is a view, you can compose a group within
/// other view builders, including nesting within other groups. This allows you
/// to add large numbers of views to different view builder containers. The
/// following example uses a `Group` to collect 10 ``SwiftUI/Text`` instances,
/// meaning that the vertical stack's view builder returns only two views ---
/// the group, plus an additional ``SwiftUI/Text``:
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Group {
///                 Text("1")

///                 Text("8")
///                 Text("9")

/// Center, align with the center of the string. The lines for the right-most
/// string, labeled Trailing, align with the right edge of the
/// string.](HorizontalAlignment-1-iOS)
///

///
///     private struct HorizontalAlignmentGallery: View {
///         var body: some View {

///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// During layout, SwiftUI aligns the views inside each stack by bringing
/// together the specified guides of the affected views. SwiftUI calculates
/// the position of a guide for a particular view based on the characteristics
/// of the view. For example, the ``HorizontalAlignment/center`` guide appears
/// at half the width of the view. You can override the guide calculation for a
/// particular view using the ``View/alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)-9mdoh``
/// view modifier.
///
/// ### Layout direction
///
/// When a user configures their device to use a left-to-right language like
/// English, the system places the leading alignment on the left and the
/// trailing alignment on the right, as the example from the previous section
/// demonstrates. However, in a right-to-left language, the system reverses
/// these. You can see this by using the ``View/environment(_:_:)`` view
/// modifier to explicitly override the ``EnvironmentValues/layoutDirection``
/// environment value for the view defined above:
///
///     HorizontalAlignmentGallery()
///         .environment(\.layoutDirection, .rightToLeft)
///
/// ![Three columns of content. Each column contains a string
/// inside a box with a vertical line above and below the box. The
/// lines are aligned horizontally with the text in a different way for each
/// column. The lines for the left-most string, labeled Trailing, align with
/// the left edge of the string. The lines for the middle string, labeled
/// Center, align with the center of the string. The lines for the right-most
/// string, labeled Leading, align with the right edge of the
/// string.](HorizontalAlignment-2-iOS)
///
/// This automatic layout adjustment makes it easier to localize your app,
/// but it's still important to test your app for the different locales that
/// you ship into. For more information about the localization process, see
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Xcode/localization>.
///
/// ### Custom alignment guides
///
/// You can create a custom horizontal alignment by creating a type that
/// conforms to the ``AlignmentID`` protocol, and then using that type to
/// initalize a new static property on `HorizontalAlignment`:
///
///     private struct OneQuarterAlignment: AlignmentID {
///         static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat {
///             context.width / 4
///         }
///     }
///
///     extension HorizontalAlignment {
///         static let oneQuarter = HorizontalAlignment(OneQuarterAlignment.self)
///     }
///
/// You implement the ``AlignmentID/defaultValue(in:)`` method to calculate
/// a default value for the custom alignment guide. The method receives a
/// ``ViewDimensions`` instance that you can use to calculate an appropriate
/// value based on characteristics of the view. The example above places
/// the guide at one quarter of the width of the view, as measured from the
/// view's origin.
///
/// You can then use the custom alignment guide like any built-in guide. For
/// example, you can use it as the `alignment` parameter to a ``VStack``,
/// or you can change it for a specific view using the
/// ``View/alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)-9mdoh`` view modifier.
/// Custom alignment guides also automatically reverse in a right-to-left
/// environment, just like built-in guides.
///
/// ### Composite alignment
///
/// Combine a ``VerticalAlignment`` with a `HorizontalAlignment` to create a
/// composite ``Alignment`` that indicates both vertical and horizontal
/// positioning in one value. For example, you could combine your custom
/// `oneQuarter` horizontal alignment from the previous section with a built-in
/// ``VerticalAlignment/center`` vertical alignment to use in a ``ZStack``:
///
///     struct LayeredVerticalStripes: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             ZStack(alignment: Alignment(horizontal: .oneQuarter, vertical: .center)) {
///                 verticalStripes(color: .blue)
///                     .frame(width: 300, height: 150)
///                 verticalStripes(color: .green)
///                     .frame(width: 180, height: 80)
///             }
///         }
///
///         private func verticalStripes(color: Color) -> some View {
///             HStack(spacing: 1) {
///                 ForEach(0..<4) { _ in color }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The example above uses widths and heights that generate two mismatched sets
/// of four vertical stripes. The ``ZStack`` centers the two sets vertically and
/// aligns them horizontally one quarter of the way from the leading edge of
/// each set. In a left-to-right locale, this aligns the right edges of the
/// left-most stripes of each set:
///
/// ![Two sets of four rectangles. The first set is blue. The
/// second set is green, is smaller, and is layered on top of the first set.
/// The two sets are centered vertically, but align horizontally at the right
/// edge of each set's left-most rectangle.](HorizontalAlignment-3-iOS)

/// Unlike other animations in SwiftUI (using ``Animation``), keyframes

/// takes over time using the tracks that make up their body.
///
/// `Keyframes` values are roughly analogous to video clips;
/// they have a set duration, and you can scrub and evaluate them for any
/// time within the duration.
///
/// The `Keyframes` structure also allows you to compute an interpolated
/// value at a specific time, which you can use when integrating keyframes
/// into custom use cases.
///
/// For example, you can use a `Keyframes` instance to define animations for a
/// type conforming to `Animatable:`
///
///     let keyframes = KeyframeTimeline(initialValue: CGPoint.zero) {
///         CubcKeyframe(.init(x: 0, y: 100), duration: 0.3)

///     }
///
///     let value = keyframes.value(time: 0.45
///
/// For animations that involve multiple coordinated changes, you can include
/// multiple nested tracks:
///
///     struct Values {
///         var rotation = Angle.zero
///         var scale = 1.0
///     }
///
///     let keyframes = KeyframeTimeline(initialValue: Values()) {
///         KeyframeTrack(\.rotation) {
///             CubicKeyframe(.zero, duration: 0.2)
///             CubicKeyframe(.degrees(45), duration: 0.3)

/// A standard label for user interface items, consisting of an icon with a

/// One of the most common and recognizable user interface components is the
/// combination of an icon and a label. This idiom appears across many kinds of
/// apps and shows up in collections, lists, menus of action items, and
/// disclosable lists, just to name a few.
///
/// You create a label, in its simplest form, by providing a title and the name
/// of an image, such as an icon from the
/// [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/)
/// collection:
///
///     Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
///
/// You can also apply styles to labels in several ways. In the case of dynamic
/// changes to the view after device rotation or change to a window size you
/// might want to show only the text portion of the label using the
/// ``LabelStyle/titleOnly`` label style:
///
///     Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
///         .labelStyle(.titleOnly)
///
/// Conversely, there's also an icon-only label style:
///
///     Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
///         .labelStyle(.iconOnly)
///
/// Some containers might apply a different default label style, such as only
/// showing icons within toolbars on macOS and iOS. To opt in to showing both
/// the title and the icon, you can apply the ``LabelStyle/titleAndIcon`` label
/// style:
///
///     Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
///         .labelStyle(.titleAndIcon)
///
/// You can also create a customized label style by modifying an existing
/// style; this example adds a red border to the default label style:
///
///     struct RedBorderedLabelStyle: LabelStyle {
///         func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
///             Label(configuration)
///                 .border(Color.red)
///         }
///     }
///
/// For more extensive customization or to create a completely new label style,
/// you'll need to adopt the ``LabelStyle`` protocol and implement a
/// ``LabelStyleConfiguration`` for the new style.
///
/// To apply a common label style to a group of labels, apply the style
/// to the view hierarchy that contains the labels:
///
///     VStack {
///         Label("Rain", systemImage: "cloud.rain")
///         Label("Snow", systemImage: "snow")
///         Label("Sun", systemImage: "sun.max")
///     }
///     .labelStyle(.iconOnly)
///
/// It's also possible to make labels using views to compose the label's icon
/// programmatically, rather than using a pre-made image. In this example, the
/// icon portion of the label uses a filled ``Circle`` overlaid
/// with the user's initials:
///
///     Label {
///         Text(person.fullName)
///             .font(.body)
///             .foregroundColor(.primary)
///         Text(person.title)
///             .font(.subheadline)
///             .foregroundColor(.secondary)
///     } icon: {
///         Circle()
///             .fill(person.profileColor)
///             .frame(width: 44, height: 44, alignment: .center)
///             .overlay(Text(person.initials))

/// a layout that matches the label of the ``Picker``:
///
///     Form {
///         LabeledContent("Custom Value") {
///             MyCustomView(value: $value)
///         }
///         Picker("Selected Value", selection: $selection) {
///             Text("Option 1").tag(1)
///             Text("Option 2").tag(2)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Custom view labels
///
/// You can assemble labeled content with an explicit view for its label
/// using the ``init(content:label:)`` initializer. For example, you can
/// rewrite the previous labeled content example using a ``Text`` view:
///
///     LabeledContent {
///         MyCustomView(value: $value)
///     } label: {
///         Text("Custom Value")
///     }
///
/// The `label` view builder accepts any kind of view, like a ``Label``:
///
///     LabeledContent {
///         MyCustomView(value: $value)
///     } label: {
///         Label("Custom Value", systemImage: "hammer")
///     }
///
/// ### Textual labeled content
///
/// You can construct labeled content with string values or formatted values
/// to create read-only displays of textual values:
///
///     Form {
///         Section("Information") {
///             LabeledContent("Name", value: person.name)
///             LabeledContent("Age", value: person.age, format: .number)
///             LabeledContent("Height", value: person.height,
///                 format: .measurement(width: .abbreviated))
///         }
///         if !person.pets.isEmpty {
///             Section("Pets") {
///                 ForEach(pet) { pet in
///                     LabeledContent(pet.species, value: pet.name)
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Wherever possible, SwiftUI makes this text selectable.
///
/// ### Compositional elements
///
/// You can use labeled content as the label for other elements. For example,
/// a ``NavigationLink`` can present a summary value for the destination it
/// links to:
///
///     Form {
///         NavigationLink(value: Settings.wifiDetail) {
///             LabeledContent("Wi-Fi", value: ssidName)
///         }
///     }
///
/// In some cases, the styling of views used as the value content is
/// specialized as well. For example, while a ``Toggle`` in an inset group
/// form on macOS is styled as a switch by default, it's styled as a checkbox
/// when used as a value element within a surrounding `LabeledContent`
/// instance:
///
///     Form {
///         LabeledContent("Source Control") {
///             Toggle("Refresh local status automatically",
///                 isOn: $refreshLocalStatus)
///             Toggle("Fetch and refresh server status automatically",
///                 isOn: $refreshServerStatus)
///             Toggle("Add and remove files automatically",
///                 isOn: $addAndRemoveFiles)
///             Toggle("Select files to commit automatically",
///                 isOn: $selectFiles)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Controlling label visibility
///
/// A label communicates the identity or purpose of the value, which is
/// important for accessibility. However, you might want to hide the label
/// in the display, and some controls or contexts may visually hide their label
/// by default. The ``View/labelsHidden()`` modifier allows controlling that
/// visibility. The following example hides both labels, producing only a
/// group of the two value views:
///
///     Group {
///         LabeledContent("Custom Value") {
///             MyCustomView(value: $value)
///         }
///         Picker("Selected Value", selection: $selection) {
///             Text("Option 1").tag(1)
///             Text("Option 2").tag(2)
///         }
///     }
///     .labelsHidden()
///
/// ### Styling labeled content
///
/// You can set label styles using the ``View/labeledContentStyle(_:)``
/// modifier. You can also build custom styles using ``LabeledContentStyle``.

///   reports the size of the composite layout view.
/// * ``Layout/placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)``
///   assigns positions to the container's subviews.
///

///
///     struct BasicVStack: Layout {
///         func sizeThatFits(
///             proposal: ProposedViewSize,
///             subviews: Subviews,
///             cache: inout ()
///         ) -> CGSize {
///             // Calculate and return the size of the layout container.
///         }

///         func placeSubviews(
///             in bounds: CGRect,
///             proposal: ProposedViewSize,
///             subviews: Subviews,
///             cache: inout ()
///         ) {
///             // Tell each subview where to appear.
///         }
///     }
///
/// Use your layout the same way you use a built-in layout
/// container, by providing a ``ViewBuilder`` with the list of subviews
/// to arrange:
///
///     BasicVStack {
///         Text("A Subview")
///         Text("Another Subview")
///     }
///
/// ### Support additional behaviors
///
/// You can optionally implement other protocol methods and properties to
/// provide more layout container features:
///
/// * Define explicit horizontal and vertical layout guides for the container by
///   implementing ``explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)-8ofeu``
///   and ``explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)-3iqmu``,
///   respectively.
/// * Establish the preferred spacing around the container by implementing
///   ``spacing(subviews:cache:)-86z2e``.
/// * Indicate the axis of orientation for a container that has characteristics
///   of a stack by implementing the ``layoutProperties-5rb5b`` static property.
/// * Create and manage a cache to store computed values across different
///   layout protocol calls by implementing ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy``.
///
/// The protocol provides default implementations for these symbols
/// if you don't implement them. See each method or property for details.
///
/// ### Add input parameters
///
/// You can define parameters as inputs to the layout, like you might
/// for a ``View``:
///
///     struct BasicVStack: Layout {
///         var alignment: HorizontalAlignment
///
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// Set the parameters at the point where you instantiate the layout:
///
///     BasicVStack(alignment: .leading) {
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// If the layout provides default values for its parameters, you can omit the
/// parameters at the call site, but you might need to keep the parentheses
/// after the name of the layout, depending on how you specify the defaults.
/// For example, suppose you set a default alignment for the basic stack in
/// the parameter declaration:
///
///     struct BasicVStack: Layout {
///         var alignment: HorizontalAlignment = .center
///
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// To instantiate this layout using the default center alignment, you don't
/// have to specify the alignment value, but you do need to add empty
/// parentheses:
///
///     BasicVStack() {
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// The Swift compiler requires the parentheses in this case because of how the
/// layout protocol implements this call site syntax. Specifically, the layout's
/// ``callAsFunction(_:)`` method looks for an initializer with exactly zero
/// input arguments when you omit the parentheses from the call site.
/// You can enable the simpler call site for a layout that doesn't have an
/// implicit initializer of this type by explicitly defining one:
///
///     init() {
///         self.alignment = .center
///     }
///
/// For information about Swift initializers, see
/// [Initialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html)
/// in *The Swift Programming Language*.
///
/// ### Interact with subviews through their proxies
///
/// To perform layout, you need information about all of its subviews, which
/// are the views that your container arranges. While your layout can't
/// interact directly with its subviews, it can access a set of subview proxies
/// through the ``Subviews`` collection that each protocol method receives as
/// an input parameter. That type is an alias for the ``LayoutSubviews``
/// collection type, which in turn contains ``LayoutSubview`` instances
/// that are the subview proxies.
///
/// You can get information about each subview from its proxy, like its
/// dimensions and spacing preferences. This enables
/// you to measure subviews before you commit to placing them. You also
/// assign a position to each subview by calling its proxy's
/// ``LayoutSubview/place(at:anchor:proposal:)`` method.
/// Call the method on each subview from within your implementation of the
/// layout's ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`` method.
///
/// ### Access layout values
///
/// Views have layout values that you set with view modifiers.
/// Layout containers can choose to condition their behavior accordingly.
/// For example, a built-in ``HStack`` allocates space to its subviews based
/// in part on the priorities that you set with the ``View/layoutPriority(_:)``
/// view modifier. Your layout container accesses this value for a subview by
/// reading the proxy's ``LayoutSubview/priority`` property.
///
/// You can also create custom layout values by creating a layout key.
/// Set a value on a view with the ``View/layoutValue(key:value:)`` view
/// modifier. Read the corresponding value from the subview's proxy using the
/// key as an index on the subview. For more information about creating,
/// setting, and accessing custom layout values, see ``LayoutValueKey``.

    typealias Subviews = LayoutSubviews

    /// Creates and initializes a cache for a layout instance.
    ///
    /// You can optionally use a cache to preserve calculated values across
    /// calls to a layout container's methods. Many layout types don't need
    /// a cache, because SwiftUI automatically reuses both the results of
    /// calls into the layout and the values that the layout reads from its
    /// subviews. Rely on the protocol's default implementation of this method
    /// if you don't need a cache.
    ///
    /// However you might find a cache useful when:
    ///
    /// - The layout container repeats complex, intermediate calculations
    /// across calls like ``sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)``,
    /// ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)``, and
    /// ``explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)-8ofeu``.
    /// You might be able to improve performance by calculating values
    /// once and storing them in a cache.
    /// - The layout container reads many ``LayoutValueKey`` values from
    /// subviews. It might be more efficient to do that once and store the
    /// results in the cache, rather than rereading the subviews' values before
    /// each layout call.
    /// - You want to maintain working storage, like temporary Swift arrays,
    /// across calls into the layout, to minimize the number of allocation
    /// events.
    ///
    /// Only implement a cache if profiling shows that it improves performance.
    ///
    /// ### Initialize a cache
    ///
    /// Implement the `makeCache(subviews:)` method to create a cache.
    /// You can add computed values to the cache right away, using information
    /// from the `subviews` input parameter, or you can do that later. The
    /// methods of the ``Layout`` protocol that can access the cache
    /// take the cache as an in-out parameter, which enables you to modify
    /// the cache anywhere that you can read it.
    ///
    /// You can use any storage type that makes sense for your layout
    /// algorithm, but be sure that you only store data that you derive
    /// from the layout and its subviews (lazily, if possible). For this to
    /// work correctly, SwiftUI needs to be able to call this method to
    /// recreate the cache without changing the layout result.
    ///
    /// When you return a cache from this method, you implicitly define a type
    /// for your cache. Be sure to either make the type of the `cache`
    /// parameters on your other ``Layout`` protocol methods match, or use
    /// a type alias to define the ``Cache`` associated type.
    ///
    /// ### Update the cache
    ///
    /// If the layout container or any of its subviews change, SwiftUI
    /// calls the ``updateCache(_:subviews:)-9hkj9`` method so you can
    /// modify or invalidate the contents of the
    /// cache. The default implementation of that method calls the
    /// `makeCache(subviews:)` method to recreate the cache, but you can
    /// provide your own implementation of the update method to take an
    /// incremental approach, if appropriate.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - subviews: A collection of proxy instances that represent the
    ///     views that the container arranges. You can use the proxies in the
    ///     collection to get information about the subviews as you
    ///     calculate values to store in the cache.
    ///
    /// - Returns: Storage for calculated data that you share among
    ///   the methods of your custom layout container.
    func makeCache(subviews: Self.Subviews) -> Self.Cache

    /// Updates the layout's cache when something changes.
    ///
    /// If your custom layout container creates a cache by implementing the
    /// ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy`` method, SwiftUI calls the update method
    /// when your layout or its subviews change, giving you an opportunity
    /// to modify or invalidate the contents of the cache.
    /// The method's default implementation recreates the
    /// cache by calling the ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy`` method,
    /// but you can provide your own implementation to take an
    /// incremental approach, if appropriate.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - cache: Storage for calculated data that you share among
    ///     the methods of your custom layout container.
    ///   - subviews: A collection of proxy instances that represent the
    ///     views arranged by the container. You can use the proxies in the

    /// for a layout container. The value you return affects
    /// the spacing around the container, but it doesn't affect how the

    /// container.
    ///
    /// Create a custom ``ViewSpacing`` instance for your container by
    /// initializing one with default values, and then merging that with
    /// spacing instances of certain subviews. For example, if you define
    /// a basic vertical stack that places subviews in a column, you could
    /// use the spacing preferences of the subview edges that make
    /// contact with the container's edges:
    ///
    ///     extension BasicVStack {
    ///         func spacing(subviews: Subviews, cache: inout ()) -> ViewSpacing {
    ///             var spacing = ViewSpacing()
    ///
    ///             for index in subviews.indices {
    ///                 var edges: Edge.Set = [.leading, .trailing]
    ///                 if index == 0 { edges.formUnion(.top) }
    ///                 if index == subviews.count - 1 { edges.formUnion(.bottom) }
    ///                 spacing.formUnion(subviews[index].spacing, edges: edges)
    ///             }
    ///
    ///             return spacing
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// In the above example, the first and last subviews contribute to the
    /// spacing above and below the container, respectively, while all subviews
    /// affect the spacing on the leading and trailing edges.
    ///
    /// If you don't implement this method, the protocol provides a default
    /// implementation, namely ``Layout/spacing(subviews:cache:)-1z0gt``,
    /// that merges the spacing preferences across all subviews on all edges.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - subviews: A collection of proxy instances that represent the
    ///     views that the container arranges. You can use the proxies in the
    ///     collection to get information about the subviews as you determine
    ///     how much spacing the container prefers around it.
    ///   - cache: Optional storage for calculated data that you can share among
    ///     the methods of your custom layout container. See
    ///     ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy`` for details.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A ``ViewSpacing`` instance that describes the preferred
    ///   spacing around the container view.
    func spacing(subviews: Self.Subviews, cache: inout Self.Cache) -> ViewSpacing

    /// Returns the size of the composite view, given a proposed size
    /// and the view's subviews.
    ///
    /// Implement this method to tell your custom layout container's parent
    /// view how much space the container needs for a set of subviews, given
    /// a size proposal. The parent might call this method more than once
    /// during a layout pass with different proposed sizes to test the
    /// flexibility of the container, using proposals like:
    ///
    /// * The ``ProposedViewSize/zero`` proposal; respond with the
    ///   layout's minimum size.
    /// * The ``ProposedViewSize/infinity`` proposal; respond with the
    ///   layout's maximum size.

    ///
    /// The parent might also choose to test flexibility in one dimension at a

    ///     private struct BasicVStack: Layout {
    ///         func sizeThatFits(
    ///             proposal: ProposedViewSize,
    ///             subviews: Subviews,
    ///             cache: inout ()
    ///         ) -> CGSize {
    ///             subviews.reduce(CGSize.zero) { result, subview in

    ///                     height: result.height + size.height)
    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///
    ///         // This layout also needs a placeSubviews() implementation.
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The implementation asks each subview for its ideal size by calling the
    /// ``LayoutSubview/sizeThatFits(_:)`` method with an
    /// ``ProposedViewSize/unspecified`` proposed size.
    /// It then reduces these values into a single size that represents
    /// the maximum subview width and the sum of subview heights.
    /// Because this example isn't flexible, it ignores its size proposal
    /// input and always returns the same value for a given set of subviews.
    ///
    /// SwiftUI views choose their own size, so the layout engine always
    /// uses a value that you return from this method as the actual size of the
    /// composite view. That size factors into the construction of the `bounds`
    /// input to the ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`` method.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - proposal: A size proposal for the container. The container's parent
    ///     view that calls this method might call the method more than once
    ///     with different proposals to learn more about the container's
    ///     flexibility before deciding which proposal to use for placement.
    ///   - subviews: A collection of proxies that represent the
    ///     views that the container arranges. You can use the proxies in the
    ///     collection to get information about the subviews as you determine
    ///     how much space the container needs to display them.
    ///   - cache: Optional storage for calculated data that you can share among
    ///     the methods of your custom layout container. See
    ///     ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy`` for details.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A size that indicates how much space the container
    ///   needs to arrange its subviews.
    func sizeThatFits(proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Self.Subviews, cache: inout Self.Cache) -> CGSize

    /// Assigns positions to each of the layout's subviews.
    ///
    /// SwiftUI calls your implementation of this method to tell your
    /// custom layout container to place its subviews. From this method, call
    /// the ``LayoutSubview/place(at:anchor:proposal:)`` method on each
    /// element in `subviews` to tell the subviews where to appear in the
    /// user interface.
    ///
    /// For example, you can create a basic vertical stack that places views
    /// in a column, with views horizontally aligned on their leading edge:
    ///
    ///     struct BasicVStack: Layout {
    ///         func placeSubviews(

    ///         }
    ///
    ///         // This layout also needs a sizeThatFits() implementation.
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The example creates a placement point that starts at the origin of the
    /// specified `bounds` input and uses that to place the first subview. It
    /// then moves the point in the y dimension by the subview's height,

    /// This prepares the point for the next iteration of the loop. All
    /// subview operations use an ``ProposedViewSize/unspecified`` size
    /// proposal to indicate that subviews should use and report their ideal
    /// size.
    ///
    /// A more complex layout container might add space between subviews
    /// according to their ``LayoutSubview/spacing`` preferences, or a
    /// fixed space based on input configuration. For example, you can extend
    /// the basic vertical stack's placement method to calculate the
    /// preferred distances between adjacent subviews and store the results in
    /// an array:
    ///
    ///     let spacing: [CGFloat] = subviews.indices.dropLast().map { index in
    ///         subviews[index].spacing.distance(
    ///             to: subviews[index + 1].spacing,
    ///             along: .vertical)
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The spacing's ``ViewSpacing/distance(to:along:)`` method considers the
    /// preferences of adjacent views on the edge where they meet. It returns
    /// the smallest distance that satisfies both views' preferences for the
    /// given edge. For example, if one view prefers at least `2` points on its
    /// bottom edge, and the next view prefers at least `8` points on its top
    /// edge, the distance method returns `8`, because that's the smallest
    /// value that satisfies both preferences.
    ///
    /// Update the placement calculations to use the spacing values:
    ///
    ///     var point = bounds.origin
    ///     for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {
    ///         if index > 0 { point.y += spacing[index - 1] } // Add spacing.
    ///         subview.place(at: point, anchor: .topLeading, proposal: .unspecified)
    ///         point.y += subview.dimensions(in: .unspecified).height
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Be sure that you use computations during placement that are consistent
    /// with those in your implementation of other protocol methods for a given
    /// set of inputs. For example, if you add spacing during placement,
    /// make sure your implementation of

/// More commonly, you create lists dynamically from an underlying collection
/// of data. The following example shows how to create a simple list from an
/// array of an `Ocean` type which conforms to
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Identifiable>:

///     }
///
/// ![A vertical list with five text views, each with the name of an
/// ocean.](List-2-iOS)
///
/// ### Supporting selection in lists
///
/// To make members of a list selectable, provide a binding to a selection
/// variable. Binding to a single instance of the list data's `Identifiable.ID`
/// type creates a single-selection list. Binding to a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Set> creates a list that
/// supports multiple selections. The following example shows how to add
/// multiselect to the previous example:
///
///     struct Ocean: Identifiable, Hashable {
///         let name: String
///         let id = UUID()
///     }
///
///     private var oceans = [
///         Ocean(name: "Pacific"),
///         Ocean(name: "Atlantic"),
///         Ocean(name: "Indian"),
///         Ocean(name: "Southern"),
///         Ocean(name: "Arctic")
///     ]
///
///     @State private var multiSelection = Set<UUID>()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             List(oceans, selection: $multiSelection) {
///                 Text($0.name)
///             }
///             .navigationTitle("Oceans")
///             .toolbar { EditButton() }
///         }
///         Text("\(multiSelection.count) selections")
///     }
///
/// When people make a single selection by tapping or clicking, the selected
/// cell changes its appearance to indicate the selection. To enable multiple
/// selections with tap gestures, put the list into edit mode by either
/// modifying the ``EnvironmentValues/editMode`` value, or adding an
/// ``EditButton`` to your app's interface. When you put the list into edit
/// mode, the list shows a circle next to each list item. The circle contains
/// a checkmark when the user selects the associated item. The example above
/// uses an Edit button, which changes its title to Done while in edit mode:
///
/// ![A navigation view with the title Oceans and a vertical list that contains
/// five text views, each with the name of an ocean. The second and third items
/// are highlighted to indicate that they are selected. At the bottom, a text
/// view reads 2 selections.](List-3-iOS)
///
/// People can make multiple selections without needing to enter edit mode on
/// devices that have a keyboard and mouse or trackpad, like Mac and iPad.
///
/// ### Refreshing the list content
///
/// To make the content of the list refreshable using the standard refresh
/// control, use the ``View/refreshable(action:)`` modifier.
///
/// The following example shows how to add a standard refresh control to a list.
/// When the user drags the top of the list downward, SwiftUI reveals the refresh
/// control and executes the specified action. Use an `await` expression
/// inside the `action` closure to refresh your data. The refresh indicator remains
/// visible for the duration of the awaited operation.
///
///     struct Ocean: Identifiable, Hashable {
///          let name: String
///          let id = UUID()
///          let stats: [String: String]
///      }
///
///      class OceanStore: ObservableObject {
///          @Published var oceans = [Ocean]()
///          func loadStats() async {}
///      }
///
///      @EnvironmentObject var store: OceanStore

///      }
///
/// ### Supporting multidimensional lists
///
/// To create two-dimensional lists, group items inside ``Section`` instances.
/// The following example creates sections named after the world's oceans,
/// each of which has ``Text`` views named for major seas attached to those
/// oceans. The example also allows for selection of a single list item,
/// identified by the `id` of the example's `Sea` type.
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         struct Sea: Hashable, Identifiable {
///             let name: String
///             let id = UUID()
///         }

///             }
///         }
///     }

/// Because this example uses single selection, people can make selections

/// ![A vertical list split into sections titled Major Pacific Ocean Seas,
/// Major Atlantic Ocean Seas, and so on. Each section has a different number of

///
/// > Note: In iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and tvOS 15 and earlier, lists support
///   selection only in edit mode, even for single selections.
///
/// ### Creating hierarchical lists
///
/// You can also create a hierarchical list of arbitrary depth by providing
/// tree-structured data and a `children` parameter that provides a key path to
/// get the child nodes at any level. The following example uses a deeply-nested
/// collection of a custom `FileItem` type to simulate the contents of a
/// file system. The list created from this data uses collapsing cells to allow
/// the user to navigate the tree structure.
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         struct FileItem: Hashable, Identifiable, CustomStringConvertible {
///             var id: Self { self }
///             var name: String
///             var children: [FileItem]? = nil
///             var description: String {

///                 }
///             }
///         }
///         let fileHierarchyData: [FileItem] = [
///           FileItem(name: "users", children:

/// where you want to localize the value of a string variable, use the string to
/// create a new `LocalizedStringKey` instance.

/// with and without localization. The title parameter provided to the
/// ``Section`` is a literal string, so SwiftUI creates a
/// `LocalizedStringKey` for it. However, the string entries in the

/// in the list use the string values verbatim.

///
/// ![A screenshot of a label on a teal background, where the area behind

///
/// ![An illustration that shows a background layer below a material layer,
/// which in turn appears below a foreground layer.](Material-2)

/// The blurring effect provided by the material isn't simple opacity. Instead,

/// heavily frosted glass. You can see this more easily with a complex
/// background, like an image:
///
///     ZStack {
///         Image("chili_peppers")
///             .resizable()

///
/// ![A screenshot of a label on an image background, where the area behind

/// For physical materials, the degree to which the background colors pass
/// through depends on the thickness. The effect also varies with light and

///
/// ![An array of labels on a teal background. The first column, labeled light
/// appearance, shows a succession of labels on blurred backgrounds where the
/// blur increases from top to bottom, resulting in lighter and lighter blur.
/// The second column, labeled dark appearance, shows a similar succession of
/// labels, except that the blur gets darker from top to bottom. The rows are
/// labeled, from top to bottom: no material, ultra thin, thin, regular, thick,
/// and ultra thick.](Material-4)
///
/// If you need a material to have a particular shape, you can use the
/// ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-20tq5`` modifier. For example, you can
/// create a material with rounded corners:
///
///     ZStack {
///         Color.teal
///         Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
///             .padding()
///             .background(.regularMaterial, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8))
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot of a label on a teal background, where the area behind
/// the label appears blurred. The blurred area has rounded corners.](Material-5)
///
/// When you add a material, foreground elements exhibit vibrancy,
/// a context-specific blend of the foreground and background colors
/// that improves contrast. However using ``View/foregroundStyle(_:)``
/// to set a custom foreground style --- excluding the hierarchical
/// styles, like ``ShapeStyle/secondary`` --- disables vibrancy.

///
///     NavigationLink("Work Folder") {
///         FolderDetail(id: workFolder.id)
///     }
///
/// ### Link to a destination view
///
/// You can perform navigation by initializing a link with a destination view
/// that you provide in the `destination` closure. For example, consider a
/// `ColorDetail` view that fills itself with a color:
///
///     struct ColorDetail: View {
///         var color: Color
///
///         var body: some View {
///             color.navigationTitle(color.description)
///         }
///     }
///
/// The following ``NavigationStack`` presents three links to color detail
/// views:
///
///     NavigationStack {
///         List {
///             NavigationLink("Mint") { ColorDetail(color: .mint) }
///             NavigationLink("Pink") { ColorDetail(color: .pink) }
///             NavigationLink("Teal") { ColorDetail(color: .teal) }
///         }
///         .navigationTitle("Colors")
///     }
///
/// ### Create a presentation link
///
/// Alternatively, you can use a navigation link to perform navigation based
/// on a presented data value. To support this, use the
/// ``View/navigationDestination(for:destination:)`` view modifier
/// inside a navigation stack to associate a view with a kind of data, and
/// then present a value of that data type from a navigation link. The
/// following example reimplements the previous example as a series of
/// presentation links:
///
///     NavigationStack {
///         List {
///             NavigationLink("Mint", value: Color.mint)
///             NavigationLink("Pink", value: Color.pink)
///             NavigationLink("Teal", value: Color.teal)
///         }
///         .navigationDestination(for: Color.self) { color in
///             ColorDetail(color: color)
///         }
///         .navigationTitle("Colors")
///     }
///
/// Separating the view from the data facilitates programmatic navigation
/// because you can manage navigation state by recording the presented data.
///
/// ### Control a presentation link programmatically
///
/// To navigate programmatically, introduce a state variable that tracks the
/// items on a stack. For example, you can create an array of colors to
/// store the stack state from the previous example, and initialize it as
/// an empty array to start with an empty stack:
///
///     @State private var colors: [Color] = []
///
/// Then pass a ``Binding`` to the state to the navigation stack:
///
///     NavigationStack(path: $colors) {
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// You can use the array to observe the current state of the stack. You can
/// also modify the array to change the contents of the stack. For example,
/// you can programmatically add ``ShapeStyle/blue`` to the array, and
/// navigation to a new color detail view using the following method:
///
///     func showBlue() {
///         colors.append(.blue)
///     }
///
/// ### Coordinate with a list
///
/// You can also use a navigation link to control ``List`` selection in a

/// A type-erased list of data representing the content of a navigation stack.

///
/// When a stack displays views that rely on only one kind of data, you can use
/// a standard collection, like an array, to hold the data. If you need to
/// present different kinds of data in a single stack, use a navigation path
/// instead. The path uses type erasure so you can manage a collection of
/// heterogeneous elements. The path also provides the usual collection
/// controls for adding, counting, and removing data elements.
///
/// ### Serialize the path
///

///
///         static func readSerializedData() -> Data? {
///             // Read data representing the path from app's persistent storage.
///         }
///
///         static func writeSerializedData(_ data: Data) {
///             // Write data representing the path to app's persistent storage.
///         }
///
///         init() {
///             if let data = Self.readSerializedData() {
///                 do {
///                     let representation = try JSONDecoder().decode(
///                         NavigationPath.CodableRepresentation.self,
///                         from: data)
///                     self.path = NavigationPath(representation)
///                 } catch {
///                     self.path = NavigationPath()
///                 }
///             } else {
///                 self.path = NavigationPath()
///             }
///         }
///
///         func save() {
///             guard let representation = path.codable else { return }
///             do {
///                 let encoder = JSONEncoder()
///                 let data = try encoder.encode(representation)
///                 Self.writeSerializedData(data)

///                 // Handle error.
///             }
///         }
///     }
///

///
/// You create a navigation split view with two or three columns, and typically
/// use it as the root view in a ``Scene``. People choose one or more
/// items in a leading column to display details about those items in
/// subsequent columns.
///
/// To create a two-column navigation split view, use the
/// ``init(sidebar:detail:)`` initializer:
///
///     @State private var employeeIds: Set<Employee.ID> = []
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationSplitView {
///             List(model.employees, selection: $employeeIds) { employee in
///                 Text(employee.name)

///         } detail: {
///             EmployeeDetails(for: employeeIds)
///         }
///     }
///
/// In the above example, the navigation split view coordinates with the
/// ``List`` in its first column, so that when people make a selection, the
/// detail view updates accordingly. Programmatic changes that you make to the
/// selection property also affect both the list appearance and the presented
/// detail view.
///
/// To create a three-column view, use the ``init(sidebar:content:detail:)``
/// initializer. The selection in the first column affects the second, and the
/// selection in the second column affects the third. For example, you can show
/// a list of departments, the list of employees in the selected department,
/// and the details about all of the selected employees:
///
///     @State private var departmentId: Department.ID? // Single selection.
///     @State private var employeeIds: Set<Employee.ID> = [] // Multiple selection.
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationSplitView {
///             List(model.departments, selection: $departmentId) { department in
///                 Text(department.name)
///             }
///         } content: {
///             if let department = model.department(id: departmentId) {
///                 List(department.employees, selection: $employeeIds) { employee in
///                     Text(employee.name)
///                 }
///             } else {
///                 Text("Select a department")
///             }
///         } detail: {
///             EmployeeDetails(for: employeeIds)
///         }
///     }
///
/// You can also embed a ``NavigationStack`` in a column. Tapping or clicking a
/// ``NavigationLink`` that appears in an earlier column sets the view that the
/// stack displays over its root view. Activating a link in the same column
/// adds a view to the stack. Either way, the link must present a data type
/// for which the stack has a corresponding
/// ``View/navigationDestination(for:destination:)`` modifier.
///
/// On watchOS and tvOS, and with narrow sizes like on iPhone or on iPad in
/// Slide Over, the navigation split view collapses all of its columns
/// into a stack, and shows the last column that displays useful information.
/// For example, the three-column example above shows the list of departments to
/// start, the employees in the department after someone selects a department,
/// and the employee details when someone selects an employee. For rows in a
/// list that have ``NavigationLink`` instances, the list draws disclosure
/// chevrons while in the collapsed state.
///
/// ### Control column visibility
///
/// You can programmatically control the visibility of navigation split view
/// columns by creating a ``State`` value of type
/// ``NavigationSplitViewVisibility``. Then pass a ``Binding`` to that state to
/// the appropriate initializer --- such as
/// ``init(columnVisibility:sidebar:detail:)`` for two columns, or
/// the ``init(columnVisibility:sidebar:content:detail:)`` for three columns.
///
/// The following code updates the first example above to always hide the
/// first column when the view appears:
///
///     @State private var employeeIds: Set<Employee.ID> = []
///     @State private var columnVisibility =
///         NavigationSplitViewVisibility.detailOnly
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationSplitView(columnVisibility: $columnVisibility) {
///             List(model.employees, selection: $employeeIds) { employee in
///                 Text(employee.name)
///             }
///         } detail: {
///             EmployeeDetails(for: employeeIds)
///         }
///     }
///
/// The split view ignores the visibility control when it collapses its columns
/// into a stack.
///
/// ### Collapsed split views
///
/// At narrow size classes, such as on iPhone or Apple Watch, a navigation split
/// view collapses into a single stack. Typically SwiftUI automatically chooses
/// the view to show on top of this single stack, based on the content of the
/// split view's columns.
///
/// For custom navigation experiences, you can provide more information to help
/// SwiftUI choose the right column. Create a `State` value of type
/// ``NavigationSplitViewColumn``. Then pass a `Binding` to that state to the
/// appropriate initializer, such as
/// ``init(preferredCompactColumn:sidebar:detail:)`` or
/// ``init(preferredCompactColumn:sidebar:content:detail:)``.
///
/// The following code shows the blue detail view when run on iPhone. When the
/// person using the app taps the back button, they'll see the yellow view. The
/// value of `preferredPreferredCompactColumn` will change from `.detail` to
/// `.sidebar`:
///
///     @State private var preferredColumn =
///         NavigationSplitViewColumn.detail
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationSplitView(preferredCompactColumn: $preferredColumn) {
///             Color.yellow
///         } detail: {
///             Color.blue
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Customize a split view
///
/// To specify a preferred column width in a navigation split view, use the
/// ``View/navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(_:)`` modifier. To set minimum,
/// maximum, and ideal sizes for a column, use
/// ``View/navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min:ideal:max:)``. You can specify a
/// different modifier in each column. The navigation split view does its
/// best to accommodate the preferences that you specify, but might make
/// adjustments based on other constraints.
///
/// To specify how columns in a navigation split view interact, use the
/// ``View/navigationSplitViewStyle(_:)`` modifier with a
/// ``NavigationSplitViewStyle`` value. For example, you can specify
/// whether to emphasize the detail column or to give all of the columns equal
/// prominence.

/// controls, like a Back button or a swipe gesture. The stack always displays
/// the most recently added view that hasn't been removed, and doesn't allow
/// the root view to be removed.
///
/// To create navigation links, associate a view with a data type by adding a
/// ``View/navigationDestination(for:destination:)`` modifier inside
/// the stack's view hierarchy. Then initialize a ``NavigationLink`` that
/// presents an instance of the same kind of data. The following stack displays
/// a `ParkDetails` view for navigation links that present data of type `Park`:
///
///     NavigationStack {
///         List(parks) { park in
///             NavigationLink(park.name, value: park)

///             ParkDetails(park: park)
///         }
///     }
///
/// In this example, the ``List`` acts as the root view and is always
/// present. Selecting a navigation link from the list adds a `ParkDetails`
/// view to the stack, so that it covers the list. Navigating back removes
/// the detail view and reveals the list again. The system disables backward
/// navigation controls when the stack is empty and the root view, namely
/// the list, is visible.
///
/// ### Manage navigation state
///
/// By default, a navigation stack manages state to keep track of the views on
/// the stack. However, your code can share control of the state by initializing
/// the stack with a binding to a collection of data values that you create.
/// The stack adds items to the collection as it adds views to the stack and
/// removes items when it removes views. For example, you can create a ``State``
/// property to manage the navigation for the park detail view:
///
///     @State private var presentedParks: [Park] = []
///
/// Initializing the state as an empty array indicates a stack with no views.
/// Provide a ``Binding`` to this state property using the dollar sign (`$`)
/// prefix when you create a stack using the ``init(path:root:)-3bt4q``
/// initializer:
///
///     NavigationStack(path: $presentedParks) {
///         List(parks) { park in
///             NavigationLink(park.name, value: park)
///         }
///         .navigationDestination(for: Park.self) { park in
///             ParkDetails(park: park)
///         }
///     }
///
/// Like before, when someone taps or clicks the navigation link for a
/// park, the stack displays the `ParkDetails` view using the associated park
/// data. However, now the stack also puts the park data in the `presentedParks`
/// array. Your code can observe this array to read the current stack state. It
/// can also modify the array to change the views on the stack. For example, you
/// can create a method that configures the stack with a specific set of parks:
///
///     func showParks() {
///         presentedParks = [Park("Yosemite"), Park("Sequoia")]
///     }
///
/// The `showParks` method replaces the stack's display with a view that shows
/// details for Sequoia, the last item in the new `presentedParks` array.
/// Navigating back from that view removes Sequoia from the array, which
/// reveals a view that shows details for Yosemite. Use a path to support
/// deep links, state restoration, or other kinds of programmatic navigation.
///
/// ### Navigate to different view types
///
/// To create a stack that can present more than one kind of view, you can add
/// multiple ``View/navigationDestination(for:destination:)`` modifiers
/// inside the stack's view hierarchy, with each modifier presenting a
/// different data type. The stack matches navigation links with navigation
/// destinations based on their respective data types.
///
/// To create a path for programmatic navigation that contains more than one
/// kind of data, you can use a ``NavigationPath`` instance as the path.

///   children property is non-`nil`
/// - `Leaf`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose
///   children property is `nil`.
/// - `Subgroup`: A type of a view that groups a parent view and a view
///   representing its children, typically with some mechanism for showing and
///   hiding the children

///     enum Flavor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///         case chocolate, vanilla, strawberry
///         var id: Self { self }
///     }
///
///     @State private var selectedFlavor: Flavor = .chocolate
///
/// You can create a picker to select among the values by providing a label, a
/// binding to the current selection, and a collection of views for the picker's
/// content. Append a tag to each of these content views using the
/// ``View/tag(_:)`` view modifier so that the type of each selection matches
/// the type of the bound state variable:
///
///     List {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             Text("Chocolate").tag(Flavor.chocolate)
///             Text("Vanilla").tag(Flavor.vanilla)
///             Text("Strawberry").tag(Flavor.strawberry)
///         }
///     }
///
/// If you provide a string label for the picker, as the example above does,
/// the picker uses it to initialize a ``Text`` view as a
/// label. Alternatively, you can use the ``init(selection:content:label:)``
/// initializer to compose the label from other views. The exact appearance
/// of the picker depends on the context. If you use a picker in a ``List``
/// in iOS, it appears in a row with the label and selected value, and a
/// chevron to indicate that you can tap the row to select a new value:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a list row that has the string Flavor on the left side,
/// and the string Chocolate on the right. The word Chocolate appears in a less
/// prominent color than the word Flavor. A right facing chevron appears to the
/// right of the word Chocolate.](Picker-1-iOS)
///
/// ### Iterating over a picker’s options
///
/// To provide selection values for the `Picker` without explicitly listing
/// each option, you can create the picker with a ``ForEach``:
///
///     Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///         ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///             Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ``ForEach`` automatically assigns a tag to the selection views using
/// each option's `id`. This is possible because `Flavor` conforms to the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Identifiable>
/// protocol.
///
/// The example above relies on the fact that `Flavor` defines the type of its
/// `id` parameter to exactly match the selection type. If that's not the case,
/// you need to override the tag. For example, consider a `Topping` type
/// and a suggested topping for each flavor:
///
///     enum Topping: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///         case nuts, cookies, blueberries
///         var id: Self { self }
///     }
///
///     extension Flavor {
///         var suggestedTopping: Topping {
///             switch self {
///             case .chocolate: return .nuts
///             case .vanilla: return .cookies
///             case .strawberry: return .blueberries
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
///     @State private var suggestedTopping: Topping = .nuts
///
/// The following example shows a picker that's bound to a `Topping` type,
/// while the options are all `Flavor` instances. Each option uses the tag
/// modifier to associate the suggested topping with the flavor it displays:
///
///     List {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $suggestedTopping) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///                     .tag(flavor.suggestedTopping)
///             }
///         }
///         HStack {
///             Text("Suggested Topping")
///             Spacer()
///             Text(suggestedTopping.rawValue.capitalized)
///                 .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
///         }
///     }
///
/// When the user selects chocolate, the picker sets `suggestedTopping`
/// to the value in the associated tag:
///
/// ![A screenshot of two list rows. The first has the string Flavor on the left
/// side, and the string Chocolate on the right. A right facing chevron appears
/// to the right of the word Chocolate. The second row has the string Suggested
/// Topping on the left, and the string Nuts on the right. Both words on the
/// right use a less prominent color than those on the left.](Picker-2-iOS)
///
/// Other examples of when the views in a picker's ``ForEach`` need an explicit
/// tag modifier include when you:
/// * Select over the cases of an enumeration that conforms to the
///   <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Identifiable> protocol
///   by using anything besides `Self` as the `id` parameter type. For example,
///   a string enumeration might use the case's `rawValue` string as the `id`.
///   That identifier type doesn't match the selection type, which is the type
///   of the enumeration itself.
/// * Use an optional value for the `selection` input parameter. For that to
///   work, you need to explicitly cast the tag modifier's input as
///   <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Optional> to match.
///   For an example of this, see ``View/tag(_:)``.
///
/// ### Styling pickers
///
/// You can customize the appearance and interaction of pickers using
/// styles that conform to the ``PickerStyle`` protocol, like
/// ``PickerStyle/segmented`` or ``PickerStyle/menu``. To set a specific style
/// for all picker instances within a view, use the ``View/pickerStyle(_:)``
/// modifier. The following example applies the ``PickerStyle/segmented``
/// style to two pickers that independently select a flavor and a topping:
///
///     VStack {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///             }
///         }
///         Picker("Topping", selection: $selectedTopping) {
///             ForEach(Topping.allCases) { topping in
///                 Text(topping.rawValue.capitalized)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///     .pickerStyle(.segmented)
///
/// ![A screenshot of two segmented controls. The first has segments labeled
/// Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry, with the first of these selected.
/// The second control has segments labeled Nuts, Cookies, and Blueberries,
/// with the second of these selected.](Picker-3-iOS)

/// When the ``EnvironmentValues/refresh`` environment value contains an

/// By default, the environment value is `nil`, but you can use the

/// refresh action that uses the handler that you specify:
///
///     List(mailbox.conversations) { conversation in
///         ConversationCell(conversation)
///     }
///     .refreshable {
///         await mailbox.fetch()
///     }

/// On iOS and iPadOS, the ``List`` in the example above offers a
/// pull to refresh gesture because it detects the refresh action. When
/// the user drags the list down and releases, the list calls the action's
/// handler. Because SwiftUI declares the handler as asynchronous, it can
/// safely make long-running asynchronous calls, like fetching network data.
///
/// ### Refreshing custom views
///
/// You can also offer refresh capability in your custom views.
/// Read the ``EnvironmentValues/refresh`` environment value to get the
/// `RefreshAction` instance for a given ``Environment``. If you find
/// a non-`nil` value, change your view's appearance or behavior to offer
/// the refresh to the user, and call the instance to conduct the
/// refresh. You can call the refresh instance directly because it defines
/// a ``RefreshAction/callAsFunction()`` method that Swift calls
/// when you call the instance:
///
///     struct RefreshableView: View {
///         @Environment(\.refresh) private var refresh
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Refresh") {
///                 Task {
///                     await refresh?()
///                 }
///             }
///             .disabled(refresh == nil)
///         }
///     }
///
/// Be sure to call the handler asynchronously by preceding it
/// with `await`. Because the call is asynchronous, you can use
/// its lifetime to indicate progress to the user. For example,
/// you might reveal an indeterminate ``ProgressView`` before
/// calling the handler, and hide it when the handler completes.
///
/// If your code isn't already in an asynchronous context, create a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Task> for the
/// method to run in. If you do this, consider adding a way for the

/// Read the ``SwiftUI/EnvironmentValues/scenePhase`` environment
/// value from within a scene or one of its views to check whether a scene is
/// active or in some other state. You can create a property that contains the
/// scene phase, which is one of the values in the ``SwiftUI/ScenePhase``
/// enumeration, using the ``SwiftUI/Environment`` attribute:

/// or ``View`` by applying the `@State` attribute to a property declaration
/// and providing an initial value. Declare state as private to prevent setting
/// it in a memberwise initializer, which can conflict with the storage

///
///     struct PlayButton: View {
///         @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false // Create the state.
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button(isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play") { // Read the state.
///                 isPlaying.toggle() // Write the state.
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// SwiftUI manages the property's storage. When the value changes, SwiftUI
/// updates the parts of the view hierarchy that depend on the value.
/// To access a state's underlying value, you use its ``wrappedValue`` property.
/// However, as a shortcut Swift enables you to access the wrapped value by
/// referring directly to the state instance. The above example reads and
/// writes the `isPlaying` state property's wrapped value by referring to the
/// property directly.
///
/// Declare state as private in the highest view in the view hierarchy that
/// needs access to the value. Then share the state with any subviews that also
/// need access, either directly for read-only access, or as a binding for
/// read-write access. You can safely mutate state properties from any thread.
///
/// > Note: If you need to store a reference type, like an instance of a class,
///   use a ``StateObject`` instead.
///
/// ### Share state with subviews
///
/// If you pass a state property to a subview, SwiftUI updates the subview
/// any time the value changes in the container view, but the subview can't
/// modify the value. To enable the subview to modify the state's stored value,
/// pass a ``Binding`` instead. You can get a binding to a state value by
/// accessing the state's ``projectedValue``, which you get by prefixing the
/// property name with a dollar sign (`$`).
///
/// For example, you can remove the `isPlaying` state from the play button in
/// the above example, and instead make the button take a binding:
///
///     struct PlayButton: View {
///         @Binding var isPlaying: Bool // Play button now receives a binding.
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button(isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play") {
///                 isPlaying.toggle()
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Then you can define a player view that declares the state and creates a
/// binding to the state using the dollar sign prefix:
///
///     struct PlayerView: View {
///         @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false // Create the state here now.
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying) // Pass a binding.
///
///                 // ...
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Like you do for a ``StateObject``, declare ``State`` as private to prevent
/// setting it in a memberwise initializer, which can conflict with the storage
/// management that SwiftUI provides. Unlike a state object, always
/// initialize state by providing a default value in the state's
/// declaration, as in the above examples. Use state only for storage that's

///             MySubView()
///                 .environmentObject(model)
///         }
///     }
///
/// SwiftUI creates a new instance of the model object only once during the
/// lifetime of the container that declares the state object. For example,
/// SwiftUI doesn't create a new instance if a view's inputs change, but does
/// create a new instance if the identity of a view changes. When published
/// properties of the observable object change, SwiftUI updates any view that
/// depends on those properties, like the ``Text`` view in the above example.
///
/// > Note: If you need to store a value type, like a structure, string, or
///   integer, use the ``State`` property wrapper instead.
///
/// ### Share state objects with subviews
///
/// You can pass a state object into a subview through a property that has the
/// ``ObservedObject`` attribute. Alternatively, add the object to the
/// environment of a view hierarchy by applying the
/// ``View/environmentObject(_:)`` modifier to a view, like `MySubView` in the
/// above code. You can then read the object inside `MySubView` or any of its
/// descendants using the ``EnvironmentObject`` attribute:
///
///     struct MySubView: View {
///         @EnvironmentObject var model: DataModel
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $model.isEnabled)
///         }
///     }
///
/// Get a ``Binding`` to the state object's properties using the dollar sign
/// (`$`) operator. Use a binding when you want to create a two-way connection.
/// In the above code, the ``Toggle`` controls the model's `isEnabled` value
/// through a binding.
///
/// ### Initialize state objects using external data
///
/// When a state object's initial state depends on data that comes from
/// outside its container, you can call the object's initializer
/// explicitly from within its container's initializer. For example,
/// suppose the data model from the previous example takes a `name`
/// input during initialization and you want to use a value for that
/// name that comes from outside the view. You can do this with
/// a call to the state object's initializer inside an explicit initializer
/// that you create for the view:
///
///     struct MyInitializableView: View {
///         @StateObject private var model: DataModel
///
///         init(name: String) {
///             // SwiftUI ensures that the following initialization uses the
///             // closure only once during the lifetime of the view, so
///             // later changes to the view's name input have no effect.
///             _model = StateObject(wrappedValue: { DataModel(name: name) }())
///         }
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Name: \(model.name)")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Use caution when doing this. SwiftUI only initializes a state object
/// the first time you call its initializer in a given view. This
/// ensures that the object provides stable storage even as the view's
/// inputs change. However, it might result in unexpected behavior or
/// unwanted side effects if you explicitly initialize the state object.
///
/// In the above example, if the `name` input to `MyInitializableView`
/// changes, SwiftUI reruns the view's initializer with the new value. However,
/// SwiftUI runs the autoclosure that you provide to the state object's
/// initializer only the first time you call the state object's initializer, so
/// the model's stored `name` value doesn't change.
///
/// Explicit state object initialization works well when the external data
/// that the object depends on doesn't change for a given instance of the
/// object's container. For example, you can create two views with different
/// constant names:
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             MyInitializableView(name: "Ravi")
///             MyInitializableView(name: "Maria")
///         }
///     }
///
/// > Important: Even for a configurable state object, you still declare it
///   as private. This ensures that you can't accidentally set the parameter
///   through a memberwise initializer of the view, because doing so can
///   conflict with the framework's storage management and produce unexpected
///   results.
///
/// ### Force reinitialization by changing view identity
///
/// If you want SwiftUI to reinitialize a state object when a view input
/// changes, make sure that the view's identity changes at the same time.
/// One way to do this is to bind the view's identity to the value that changes
/// using the ``View/id(_:)`` modifier. For example, you can ensure that
/// the identity of an instance of `MyInitializableView` changes when its
/// `name` input changes:
///
///     MyInitializableView(name: name)
///         .id(name) // Binds the identity of the view to the name property.
///
/// > NOTE: If your view appears inside a ``ForEach``, it implicitly receives an
///   ``View/id(_:)`` modifier that uses the identifier of the corresponding
///   data element.
///
/// If you need the view to reinitialize state based on changes in more than
/// one value, you can combine the values into a single identifier using a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Hasher>. For example,
/// if you want to update the data model in `MyInitializableView` when the
/// values of either `name` or `isEnabled` change, you can combine both
/// variables into a single hash:
///
///     var hash: Int {
///         var hasher = Hasher()
///         hasher.combine(name)
///         hasher.combine(isEnabled)
///         return hasher.finalize()
///     }
///
/// Then apply the combined hash to the view as an identifier:
///
///     MyInitializableView(name: name, isEnabled: isEnabled)
///         .id(hash)
///
/// Be mindful of the performance cost of reinitializing the state object every
/// time the input changes. Also, changing view identity can have side
/// effects. For example, SwiftUI doesn't automatically animate
/// changes inside the view if the view's identity changes at the same time.
/// Also, changing the identity resets _all_ state held by the view, including
/// values that you manage as ``State``, ``FocusState``, ``GestureState``,
/// and so on.

/// ### Supporting selection in tables
///
/// To make rows of a table selectable, provide a binding to a selection
/// variable. Binding to a single instance of the table data's
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Identifiable/3285392-id>
/// type creates a single-selection table. Binding to a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Set> creates a table that
/// supports multiple selections. The following example shows how to add
/// multi-select to the previous example. A ``Text`` view below the table shows
/// the number of items currently selected.
///
///     struct SelectableTable: View {
///         @State private var selectedPeople = Set<Person.ID>()
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Table(people, selection: $selectedPeople) {
///                 TableColumn("Given Name", value: \.givenName)
///                 TableColumn("Family Name", value: \.familyName)
///                 TableColumn("E-Mail Address", value: \.emailAddress)
///             }
///             Text("\(selectedPeople.count) people selected")
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Supporting sorting in tables
///
/// To make the columns of a table sortable, provide a binding to an array
/// of <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Foundation/SortComparator>
/// instances. The table reflects the sorted state through its column
/// headers, allowing sorting for any columns with key paths.
///
/// When the table sort descriptors update, re-sort the data collection
/// that underlies the table; the table itself doesn't perform a sort operation.
/// You can watch for changes in the sort descriptors by using a
/// ``View/onChange(of:perform:)`` modifier, and then sort the data in the
/// modifier's `perform` closure.
///
/// The following example shows how to add sorting capability to the
/// previous example:
///
///     struct SortableTable: View {
///         @State private var sortOrder = [KeyPathComparator(\Person.givenName)]
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Table(people, sortOrder: $sortOrder) {
///                 TableColumn("Given Name", value: \.givenName)
///                 TableColumn("Family Name", value: \.familyName)
///                 TableColumn("E-Mail address", value: \.emailAddress)
///             }
///             .onChange(of: sortOrder) {
///                 people.sort(using: $0)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Building tables with static rows
///
/// To create a table from static rows, rather than the contents of a collection
/// of data, you provide both the columns and the rows.
///
/// The following example shows a table that calculates prices from applying
/// varying gratuities ("tips") to a fixed set of prices. It creates the table
/// with the ``Table/init(of:columns:rows:)`` initializer, with the `rows`

///
/// ### Styling tables
///
/// Use the ``View/tableStyle(_:)`` modifier to set a ``TableStyle`` for all
/// tables within a view. SwiftUI provides several table styles, such as
/// ``InsetTableStyle`` and, on macOS, ``BorderedTableStyle``. The default
/// style is ``AutomaticTableStyle``, which is available on all platforms
/// that support `Table`.
///
/// ### Using tables on different platforms
///
/// You can define a single table for use on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.
/// However, in a compact horizontal size class environment --- typical on
/// iPhone or on iPad in certain modes, like Slide Over --- the table has
/// limited space to display its columns. To conserve space, the table
/// automatically hides headers and all columns after the first when it detects
/// this condition.
///
/// To provide a good user experience in a space-constrained environment, you
/// can customize the first column to show more information when you detect that
/// the ``EnvironmentValues/horizontalSizeClass`` environment value becomes
/// ``UserInterfaceSizeClass/compact``. For example, you can modify the sortable
/// table from above to conditionally show all the information in
/// the first column:
///
///     struct CompactableTable: View {
///         #if os(iOS)
///         @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) private var horizontalSizeClass
///         private var isCompact: Bool { horizontalSizeClass == .compact }
///         #else
///         private let isCompact = false
///         #endif
///
///         @State private var sortOrder = [KeyPathComparator(\Person.givenName)]
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Table(people, sortOrder: $sortOrder) {
///                 TableColumn("Given Name", value: \.givenName) { person in
///                     VStack(alignment: .leading) {
///                         Text(isCompact ? person.fullName : person.givenName)
///                         if isCompact {
///                             Text(person.emailAddress)
///                                 .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
///                         }
///                     }
///                 }
///                 TableColumn("Family Name", value: \.familyName)
///                 TableColumn("E-Mail Address", value: \.emailAddress)
///             }
///             .onChange(of: sortOrder) {
///                 people.sort(using: $0)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// By making this change, you provide a list-like appearance for narrower
/// displays, while displaying the full table on wider ones.
/// Because you use the same table instance in both cases, you get a seamless
/// transition when the size class changes, like when someone moves your app
/// into or out of Slide Over.

/// ### Localizing strings
///
/// If you initialize a text view with a string literal, the view uses the
/// ``Text/init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:)`` initializer, which interprets the
/// string as a localization key and searches for the key in the table you
/// specify, or in the default table if you don't specify one.
///
///     Text("pencil") // Searches the default table in the main bundle.
///
/// For an app localized in both English and Spanish, the above view displays
/// "pencil" and "lápiz" for English and Spanish users, respectively. If the
/// view can't perform localization, it displays the key instead. For example,
/// if the same app lacks Danish localization, the view displays "pencil" for
/// users in that locale. Similarly, an app that lacks any localization
/// information displays "pencil" in any locale.
///
/// To explicitly bypass localization for a string literal, use the
/// ``Text/init(verbatim:)`` initializer.
///
///     Text(verbatim: "pencil") // Displays the string "pencil" in any locale.
///
/// If you intialize a text view with a variable value, the view uses the
/// ``Text/init(_:)-9d1g4`` initializer, which doesn't localize the string. However,
/// you can request localization by creating a ``LocalizedStringKey`` instance
/// first, which triggers the ``Text/init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:)``
/// initializer instead:
///
///     // Don't localize a string variable...
///     Text(writingImplement)
///
///     // ...unless you explicitly convert it to a localized string key.
///     Text(LocalizedStringKey(writingImplement))
///
/// When localizing a string variable, you can use the default table by omitting
/// the optional initialization parameters — as in the above example — just like
/// you might for a string literal.

///
/// ### Text field prompts
///
/// You can set an explicit prompt on the text field to guide users on what
/// text they should provide. Each text field style determines where and
/// when the text field uses a prompt and label. For example, a form on macOS
/// always places the label at the leading edge of the field and
/// uses a prompt, when available, as placeholder text within the field itself.
/// In the same context on iOS, the text field uses either the prompt or label
/// as placeholder text, depending on whether the initializer provided a prompt.
///
/// The following example shows a ``Form`` with two text fields, each of which
/// provides a prompt to indicate that the field is required, and a view builder
/// to provide a label:
///
///     Form {
///         TextField(text: $username, prompt: Text("Required")) {
///             Text("Username")
///         }
///         SecureField(text: $password, prompt: Text("Required")) {
///             Text("Password")
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A macOS form, showing two text fields, arranged vertically, with labels to
/// the side that say Username and Password, respectively. Inside each text
/// field, the prompt text says Required.](TextField-prompt-1)
///
/// ![An iOS form, showing two text fields, arranged vertically, with prompt
/// text that says Required.](TextField-prompt-2)
///
/// ### Styling text fields
///
/// SwiftUI provides a default text field style that reflects an appearance and
/// behavior appropriate to the platform. The default style also takes the
/// current context into consideration, like whether the text field is in a
/// container that presents text fields with a special style. Beyond this, you
/// can customize the appearance and interaction of text fields using the
/// ``View/textFieldStyle(_:)`` modifier, passing in an instance of
/// ``TextFieldStyle``. The following example applies the
/// ``TextFieldStyle/roundedBorder`` style to both text fields within a ``VStack``.
///
///     @State private var givenName: String = ""
///     @State private var familyName: String = ""
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             TextField(
///                 "Given Name",
///                 text: $givenName
///             )
///             .disableAutocorrection(true)
///             TextField(
///                 "Family Name",
///                 text: $familyName
///             )

///

/// to construct a view that has the appearance and behavior of a toggle, see
/// ``ToggleStyle/makeBody(configuration:)``.
///
/// To provide easy access to the new style, declare a corresponding static

///
///     extension ToggleStyle where Self == ChecklistToggleStyle {
///         static var checklist: ChecklistToggleStyle { .init() }
///     }

/// You can then use your custom style:

///         .toggleStyle(.checklist)

    /// of the `makeBody(configuration:)` method for each ``Toggle`` instance
    /// that uses the associated style.
    ///
    /// ### Modify the current style
    ///
    /// Rather than create an entirely new style, you can alternatively
    /// modify a toggle's current style. Use the ``Toggle/init(_:)``
    /// initializer inside the `makeBody(configuration:)` method to create
    /// and modify a toggle based on a `configuration` value. For example,
    /// you can create a style that adds padding and a red border to the
    /// current style:
    ///
    ///     struct RedBorderToggleStyle: ToggleStyle {
    ///         func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
    ///             Toggle(configuration)
    ///                 .padding()
    ///                 .border(.red)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// If you create a `redBorder` static variable from this style,
    /// you can apply the style to toggles that already use another style, like
    /// the built-in ``ToggleStyle/switch`` and ``ToggleStyle/button`` styles:
    ///
    ///     Toggle("Switch", isOn: $isSwitchOn)
    ///         .toggleStyle(.redBorder)
    ///         .toggleStyle(.switch)
    ///
    ///     Toggle("Button", isOn: $isButtonOn)
    ///         .toggleStyle(.redBorder)
    ///         .toggleStyle(.button)
    ///
    /// Both toggles appear with the usual styling, each with a red border:
    ///
    /// ![A screenshot of a switch toggle with a red border, and a button
    /// toggle with a red border.](ToggleStyle-makeBody-2-iOS)
    ///
    /// Apply the custom style closer to the toggle than the
    /// modified style because SwiftUI evaluates style view modifiers in order
    /// from outermost to innermost. If you apply the styles in the other
    /// order, the red border style doesn't have an effect, because the
    /// built-in styles override it completely.
    ///
    /// - Parameter configuration: The properties of the toggle, including a

    ///
    /// * A toggle that appears as part of the content that you provide to one

///
///     let unitPoint = UnitPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.5)

/// * Override the alignment of the view in a ``Grid`` cell using the
///   ``View/gridCellAnchor(_:)`` view modifier. The grid aligns the projection
///   of a unit point onto the view with the projection of the same unit point
///   onto the cell.
/// * Create a gradient that has a center, or start and stop points, relative
///   to the shape that you are styling. See the gradient methods in
///   ``ShapeStyle``.
///
/// You can create custom unit points with explicit values, like the example
/// above, or you can use one of the built-in unit points that SwiftUI provides,
/// like ``zero``, ``center``, or ``topTrailing``. The built-in values
/// correspond to the alignment positions of the similarly named, built-in

/// applies the change to all aspects of the system. For example, see the
/// discussion about layout direction in ``HorizontalAlignment``.

/// distribute your app in. For more information about the localization process,

/// are, in order, top, center, bottom, first text baseline, and last text
/// baseline.](VerticalAlignment-1-iOS)

///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// During layout, SwiftUI aligns the views inside each stack by bringing
/// together the specified guides of the affected views. SwiftUI calculates
/// the position of a guide for a particular view based on the characteristics
/// of the view. For example, the ``VerticalAlignment/center`` guide appears
/// at half the height of the view. You can override the guide calculation for a
/// particular view using the ``View/alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)-6y3u2``
/// view modifier.
///
/// ### Text baseline alignment
///
/// Use the ``VerticalAlignment/firstTextBaseline`` or
/// ``VerticalAlignment/lastTextBaseline`` guide to match the bottom of either
/// the top- or bottom-most line of text that a view contains, respectively.
/// Text baseline alignment excludes the parts of characters that descend
/// below the baseline, like the tail on lower case g and j:
///
///     row(alignment: .firstTextBaseline, text: "fghijkl")
///
/// If you use a text baseline alignment on a view that contains no text,
/// SwiftUI applies the equivalent of ``VerticalAlignment/bottom`` alignment
/// instead. For the row in the example above, SwiftUI matches the bottom of
/// the horizontal lines with the baseline of the text:
///
/// ![A string containing the lowercase letters f, g, h, i, j, and
/// k. The string is inside a box, and horizontal lines appear to the left and
/// to the right of the box. The lines align with the bottom of the text,
/// excluding the descenders of letters g and j, which extend below the
/// baseline.](VerticalAlignment-2-iOS)
///
/// Aligning a text view to its baseline rather than to the bottom of its frame
/// produces the best layout effect in many cases, like when creating forms.
/// For example, you can align the baseline of descriptive text in
/// one ``GridRow`` cell with the baseline of a text field, or the label
/// of a checkbox, in another cell in the same row.
///
/// ### Custom alignment guides
///
/// You can create a custom vertical alignment guide by first creating a type
/// that conforms to the ``AlignmentID`` protocol, and then using that type to
/// initalize a new static property on `VerticalAlignment`:
///
///     private struct FirstThirdAlignment: AlignmentID {
///         static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat {
///             context.height / 3
///         }
///     }
///
///     extension VerticalAlignment {
///         static let firstThird = VerticalAlignment(FirstThirdAlignment.self)
///     }
///
/// You implement the ``AlignmentID/defaultValue(in:)`` method to calculate
/// a default value for the custom alignment guide. The method receives a
/// ``ViewDimensions`` instance that you can use to calculate a
/// value based on characteristics of the view. The example above places
/// the guide at one-third of the height of the view as measured from the
/// view's origin.
///
/// You can then use the custom alignment guide like any built-in guide. For
/// example, you can use it as the `alignment` parameter to an ``HStack``,
/// or to alter the guide calculation for a specific view using the
/// ``View/alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)-6y3u2`` view modifier.
///
/// ### Composite alignment
///
/// Combine a `VerticalAlignment` with a ``HorizontalAlignment`` to create a
/// composite ``Alignment`` that indicates both vertical and horizontal
/// positioning in one value. For example, you could combine your custom
/// `firstThird` vertical alignment from the previous section with a built-in
/// ``HorizontalAlignment/center`` horizontal alignment to use in a ``ZStack``:
///
///     struct LayeredHorizontalStripes: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             ZStack(alignment: Alignment(horizontal: .center, vertical: .firstThird)) {
///                 horizontalStripes(color: .blue)
///                     .frame(width: 180, height: 90)
///                 horizontalStripes(color: .green)
///                     .frame(width: 70, height: 60)
///             }
///         }
///
///         private func horizontalStripes(color: Color) -> some View {
///             VStack(spacing: 1) {
///                 ForEach(0..<3) { _ in color }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The example above uses widths and heights that generate two mismatched
/// sets of three vertical stripes. The ``ZStack`` centers the two sets
/// horizontally and aligns them vertically one-third from the top
/// of each set. This aligns the bottom edges of the top stripe from each set:
///
/// ![Two sets of three vertically stacked rectangles. The first
/// set is blue. The second set of rectangles are green, smaller, and layered
/// on top of the first set. The two sets are centered horizontally, but align
/// vertically at the bottom edge of each set's top-most

/// The `View` protocol provides a set of modifiers — protocol

/// text view returns a new view with some amount of transparency:
///
///     Text("Hello, World!")
///         .opacity(0.5) // Display partially transparent text.
///
/// The complete list of default modifiers provides a large set of controls
/// for managing views.
/// For example, you can fine tune <doc:View-Layout>,
/// add <doc:View-Accessibility> information,
/// and respond to <doc:View-Input-and-Events>.
/// You can also collect groups of default modifiers into new,

    /// Optionally, you can add a custom primary action to the context menu. In

    /// For example, you can modify the context menu from the previous example
    /// so that double clicking the row on macOS opens a new window for
    /// selected items. Get the ``OpenWindowAction`` from the environment:

    /// When you use the `gridCellAnchor(_:)` modifier on a

    /// for the associated cell. With anchor alignment, the grid projects a
    /// ``UnitPoint`` that you specify onto both the view and the cell, and

    ///
    /// The grid creates red reference squares in the first row and column to
    /// establish row and column sizes. Without the anchor modifier, the blue
    /// marker in the remaining cell would appear at the center of its cell,

    /// ![A screenshot of a grid with two rows and two columns. The cells in

    ///
    /// If you use the ``View/gridCellColumns(_:)`` modifier to cause
    /// a cell to span more than one column, or if you place a view in a grid
    /// outside of a row so that the view spans the entire grid, the grid
    /// automatically converts its vertical and horizontal alignment guides
    /// to the unit point equivalent for the merged cell, and uses an
    /// anchor-based approach for that cell. For example, the following grid
    /// places the marker at the center of the merged cell by converting the
    /// grid's default ``Alignment/center`` alignment guide to a
    /// ``UnitPoint/center`` anchor for the blue marker in the merged cell:
    ///
    ///     Grid(alignment: .center, horizontalSpacing: 1, verticalSpacing: 1) {
    ///         GridRow {
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///         }
    ///         GridRow {
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///             Color.blue.frame(width: 10, height: 10)
    ///                 .gridCellColumns(2)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The grid makes this conversion in part to avoid ambiguity. Each column
    /// has its own horizontal guide, and it isn't clear which of these
    /// a cell that spans multiple columns should align with. Further, in
    /// the example above, neither of the center alignment guides for the
    /// second or third column would provide the expected behavior, which is
    /// to center the marker in the merged cell. Anchor alignment provides
    /// this behavior:

    /// ![A screenshot of a grid with two rows and three columns. The cells in

    /// an appropriate replacement, `⌘Ö` in this case.

    /// `⌘[` can reveal a previous view. Following the layout direction of
    /// the UI, this shortcut will be automatically mirrored to `⌘]`.
    /// However, this does not apply to items such as "Align Left `⌘{`",
    /// which will be "left" independently of the layout direction.
    /// When the shortcut shouldn't follow the directionality of the UI, but rather
    /// be the same in both right-to-left and left-to-right directions, using
    /// ``KeyboardShortcut/Localization-swift.struct/withoutMirroring``
    /// will prevent the system from flipping it.

    ///         CommandMenu("Card") {
    ///             Button("Align Left") { ... }
    ///                 .keyboardShortcut("{",
    ///                      modifiers: .option,

/// * Modify an alignment guide on a view;
///   see ``View/alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)-9mdoh``.
/// * Ask for the dimensions of a subview of a custom view layout;
///   see ``LayoutSubview/dimensions(in:)``.
///
/// ### Custom alignment guides
///
/// You receive an instance of this structure as the `context` parameter to
/// the ``AlignmentID/defaultValue(in:)`` method that you implement to produce
/// the default offset for an alignment guide, or as the first argument to the
/// closure you provide to the ``View/alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)-6y3u2``
/// view modifier to override the default calculation for an alignment guide.
/// In both cases you can use the instance, if helpful, to calculate the
/// offset for the guide. For example, you could compute a default offset
/// for a custom ``VerticalAlignment`` as a fraction of the view's ``height``:
///
///     private struct FirstThirdAlignment: AlignmentID {
///         static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat {
///             context.height / 3
///         }
///     }
///
///     extension VerticalAlignment {
///         static let firstThird = VerticalAlignment(FirstThirdAlignment.self)
///     }
///
/// As another example, you could use the view dimensions instance to look
/// up the offset of an existing guide and modify it:
///
///     struct ViewDimensionsOffset: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack(alignment: .leading) {
///                 Text("Default")
///                 Text("Indented")
///                     .alignmentGuide(.leading) { context in
///                         context[.leading] - 10
///                     }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The example above indents the second text view because the subtraction
/// moves the second text view's leading guide in the negative x direction,
/// which is to the left in the view's coordinate space. As a result,
/// SwiftUI moves the second text view to the right, relative to the first
/// text view, to keep their leading guides aligned:
///
/// ![A screenshot of two strings. The first says Default and the second,
/// which appears below the first, says Indented. The left side of the second
/// string appears horizontally offset to the right from the left side of the
/// first string by about the width of one character.](ViewDimensions-1-iOS)
///
/// ### Layout direction
///
/// The discussion above describes a left-to-right language environment,
/// but you don't change your guide calculation to operate in a right-to-left
/// environment. SwiftUI moves the view's origin from the left to the right side
/// of the view and inverts the positive x direction. As a result,
/// the existing calculation produces the same effect, but in the opposite
/// direction.
///
/// You can see this if you use the ``View/environment(_:_:)``
/// modifier to set the ``EnvironmentValues/layoutDirection`` property for the
/// view that you defined above:
///
///     ViewDimensionsOffset()
///         .environment(\.layoutDirection, .rightToLeft)
///
/// With no change in your guide, this produces the desired effect ---
/// it indents the second text view's right side, relative to the
/// first text view's right side. The leading edge is now on the right,
/// and the direction of the offset is reversed:
///
/// ![A screenshot of two strings. The first says Default and the second,
/// which appears below the first, says Indented. The right side of the second
/// string appears horizontally offset to the left from the right side of the
/// first string by about the width of one character.](ViewDimensions-2-iOS)

/// A scene that presents its content in a single, unique window.

///      @main
///      struct Mail: App {
///          var body: some Scene {

///                  ConnectionDoctor()
///              }
///          }
///      }
///
/// Provide a title as the first argument to the window's intializer.
/// The system uses the title to identify the window to people using your app
/// in the window's title bar or in the list of available singleton windows
/// that the Windows menu displays automatically.

/// > Note: You can override the title in the window's title bar by adding
///   one of the ``View/navigationTitle(_:)-avgj`` view modifiers to the
///   window's content. This enables you to dynamically update the title bar.
///
/// ### Open a window programmatically
///
/// People open the window by selecting it in the Windows menu, but you can also
/// open the window programmatically using the ``EnvironmentValues/openWindow``
/// action that you read from the environment. Use the `id` parameter that you
/// initialize the window with to indicate which window to open. For example,
/// you can create a button to open the window from the previous example:
///
///     struct OpenConnectionDoctorButton: View {
///         @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Connection doctor") {
///                 openWindow(id: "connection-doctor") // Match the window's identifier.
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// If the window is already open when you call this action, the action brings
/// the open window to the front. Be sure to use unique identifiers across all
/// of the `Window` and ``WindowGroup`` instances that you define.
///
/// ### Dismiss a window programmatically
///
/// The system provides people with controls to close windows, but you can also
/// close a window programmatically using the ``EnvironmentValues/dismiss``
/// action from within the window's view hierarchy. For example, you can
/// include a button in the connection doctor view that dismisses the view:
///
///     struct ConnectionDoctor: View {
///         @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 // ...
///
///                 Button("Dismiss") {
///                     dismiss()
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The dismiss action doesn't close the window if you call it from a
/// modal --- like a sheet or a popover --- that you present from within
/// the window. In that case, the action dismisses the modal presentation
/// instead.
///
/// ### Use a window as the main scene
///
/// You can use a window as the main scene of your app when multi-window
/// functionality isn't appropriate. For example, it might not make sense to
/// display more than one window for a video call app that relies on a
/// hardware resource, like a camera:
///
///     @main
///     struct VideoCall: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             Window("VideoCall", id: "main") {
///                 CameraView()
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// If your app uses a single window as its primary scene, the app quits when
/// the window closes. This behavior differs from an app that uses
/// a ``WindowGroup`` as its primary scene, where the app continues to run
/// even after closing all of its windows.
///
/// > Note: In most cases it's best to use a ``WindowGroup`` to represent the
/// main scene of your app. A window group provides multi-window functionality
/// on platforms that support it, like iPadOS and macOS, and makes it easier
/// to share code across platforms.

    /// implementation of the required ``SwiftUI/Scene/body-swift.property``

    public typealias Body = some Scene
}

/// A scene that presents a group of identically structured windows.
///
/// Use a `WindowGroup` as a container for a view hierarchy that your app
/// presents. The hierarchy that you declare as the group's content serves as a
/// template for each window that the app creates from that group:
///
///     @main
///     struct Mail: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MailViewer() // Define a view hierarchy for the window.
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// SwiftUI takes care of certain platform-specific behaviors. For example,
/// on platforms that support it, like macOS and iPadOS, people can open more
/// than one window from the group simultaneously. In macOS, people
/// can gather open windows together in a tabbed interface. Also in macOS,
/// window groups automatically provide commands for standard window
/// management.
///
/// > Important: To enable an iPadOS app to simultaneously display multiple
/// windows, be sure to include the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/uiapplicationscenemanifest/uiapplicationsupportsmultiplescenes>
/// key with a value of `true` in the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/uiapplicationscenemanifest>
/// dictionary of your app's Information Property List.
///
/// Every window in the group maintains independent state. For example, the
/// system allocates new storage for any ``State`` or ``StateObject`` variables
/// instantiated by the scene's view hierarchy for each window that it creates.
///
/// For document-based apps, use ``DocumentGroup`` to define windows instead.
///
/// ### Open windows programmatically
///
/// If you initialize a window group with an identifier, a presentation type,
/// or both, you can programmatically open a window from the group. For example,
/// you can give the mail viewer scene from the previous example an identifier:
///
///     WindowGroup(id: "mail-viewer") { // Identify the window group.
///         MailViewer()
///     }
///
/// Elsewhere in your code, you can use the ``EnvironmentValues/openWindow``
/// action from the environment to create a new window from the group:
///
///     struct NewViewerButton: View {
///         @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Open new mail viewer") {
///                 openWindow(id: "mail-viewer") // Match the group's identifier.
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Be sure to use unique strings for identifiers that you apply to window
/// groups in your app.
///
/// ### Present data in a window
///
/// If you initialize a window group with a presentation type, you can pass
/// data of that type to the window when you open it. For example, you can
/// define a second window group for the Mail app that displays a specified
/// message:
///
///     @main
///     struct Mail: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MailViewer(id: "mail-viewer")
///             }
///
///             // A window group that displays messages.
///             WindowGroup(for: Message.ID.self) { $messageID in
///                 MessageDetail(messageID: messageID)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// When you call the ``EnvironmentValues/openWindow`` action with a
/// value, SwiftUI finds the window group with the matching type
/// and passes a binding to the value into the window group's content closure.
/// For example, you can define a button that opens a message by passing
/// the message's identifier:
///
///     struct NewMessageButton: View {
///         var message: Message
///         @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Open message") {
///                 openWindow(value: message.id)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Be sure that the type you present conforms to both the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Hashable>
/// and <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Codable> protocols.
/// Also, prefer lightweight data for the presentation value.
/// For model values that conform to the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Identifiable> protocol,
/// the value's identifier works well as a presentation type, as the above
/// example demonstrates.
///
/// If a window with a binding to the same value that you pass to the
/// `openWindow` action already appears in the user interface, the system
/// brings the existing window to the front rather than opening a new window.
/// If SwiftUI doesn't have a value to provide --- for example, when someone
/// opens a window by choosing File > New Window from the macOS menu bar ---
/// SwiftUI passes a binding to a `nil` value instead. To avoid receiving a
/// `nil` value, you can optionally specify a default value in your window
/// group initializer. For example, for the message viewer, you can present
/// a new empty message:
///
///     WindowGroup(for: Message.ID.self) { $messageID in
///         MessageDetail(messageID: messageID)
///     } defaultValue: {
///         model.makeNewMessage().id // A new message that your model stores.
///     }
///
/// SwiftUI persists the value of the binding for the purposes of state
/// restoration, and reapplies the same value when restoring the window. If the
/// restoration process results in an error, SwiftUI sets the binding to the
/// default value if you provide one, or `nil` otherwise.
///
/// ### Title your app's windows
///
/// To help people distinguish among windows from different groups,
/// include a title as the first parameter in the group's initializer:
///
///     WindowGroup("Message", for: Message.ID.self) { $messageID in
///         MessageDetail(messageID: messageID)
///     }
///
/// SwiftUI uses this title when referring to the window in:
///
/// * The list of new windows that someone can open using the File > New menu.
/// * The window's title bar.
/// * The list of open windows that the Window menu displays.
///
/// If you don't provide a title for a window, the system refers to the window
/// using the app's name instead.
///
/// > Note: You can override the title that SwiftUI uses for a window in the
///   window's title bar and the menu's list of open windows by adding one of
///   the ``View/navigationTitle(_:)-avgj`` modifiers to the window's content.
///   This enables you to customize and dynamically update the title for each
///   individual window instance.
///
/// ### Distinguish windows that present like data
///
/// To programmatically distinguish between windows that present the same type
/// of data, like when you use a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Foundation/UUID>
/// as the identifier for more than one model type, add the `id` parameter
/// to the group's initializer to provide a unique string identifier:
///
///     WindowGroup("Message", id: "message", for: UUID.self) { $uuid in
///         MessageDetail(uuid: uuid)
///     }
///     WindowGroup("Account", id: "account-info", for: UUID.self) { $uuid in
///         AccountDetail(uuid: uuid)
///     }
///
/// Then use both the identifer and a value to open the window:
///
///     struct ActionButtons: View {
///         var messageID: UUID
///         var accountID: UUID
///
///         @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow
///
///         var body: some View {
///             HStack {
///                 Button("Open message") {
///                     openWindow(id: "message", value: messageID)
///                 }
///                 Button("Edit account information") {
///                     openWindow(id: "account-info", value: accountID)
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Dismiss a window programmatically
///
/// The system provides people with platform-appropriate controls to dismiss a
/// window. You can also dismiss windows programmatically by calling the
/// ``EnvironmentValues/dismiss`` action from within the window's view
/// hierarchy. For example, you can include a button in the account detail
/// view from the previous example that dismisses the view:
///
///     struct AccountDetail: View {
///         var uuid: UUID?
///         @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 // ...
///
///                 Button("Dismiss") {
///                     dismiss()
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The dismiss action doesn't close the window if you call it from a
/// modal --- like a sheet or a popover --- that you present
/// from the window. In that case, the action dismisses the modal presentation
/// instead.
